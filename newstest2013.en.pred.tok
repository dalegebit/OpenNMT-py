A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of President
The Republican leadership of the Republican leaders of the European Union will have the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the <unk> Centre considers it to be a myth , stating that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by the <unk> .
Moreover , Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years &apos; time .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative effect on the turnout .
In this respect , these measures are partly in line with the American democratic system .
Contrary to Canada , the American states are responsible for organising the federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments will be <unk> from 2009 to new laws that make the registration or vote more difficult .
This phenomenon has taken place on the scale after the November 2010 elections , which were to be added to <unk> new Republican representatives in 26 states .
As a result , 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in the year of 2011 alone .
New electoral laws require the voters to have an identity card with a photograph and evidence of American citizenship .
Furthermore , these laws also reduce voting periods in anticipation , <unk> the right to take place as a voter on the day of the ballot and withdraw the citizens with a judicial dossier their right to vote .
Before the 2006 elections , no US state required voters to present an identity card with a photograph .
<unk> was the first state to make such a requirement .
The Supreme Court of the United States is <unk> in 2008 in 2008 .
The <unk> authorities will be able to extend this practice to other states .
Over the last two years , it will be up to us in 34 states to force the voters to present an identity card with a photograph .
It is important to note that , unlike Quebec , American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , and 21 million people in voting age , do not have identity cards with a photograph from a government agency of their state .
Furthermore , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity .
However , it is often more than a hundred dollars to get the identity card .
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people , minorities , and low-income people .
In fact , 25 % of the <unk> , 15 % of people who earn less than USD 35 000 ; 18 % of the citizens of over 65 and 20 % of the voters of 18 to 29 years do not have the identity card required with photograph .
More than that .
Students , voters who are considered to be voting more for the democratic candidates , are not allowed in a number of states to use their identity card with photograph from their institution .
On the other hand , the same states allow the members of fishing clubs or hunting clubs to vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs .
Before 2004 , there was no state of citizenship to vote on the basis of the vote .
<unk> was the first to present such a requirement .
Since 2011 , a dozen countries have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the <unk> vote .
However , it appears that there are two voters who are in favour of the Democratic Party .
On the other hand , Republican legislators have sponsored laws that abolish the inclusion of voters on the day of the vote in eight states .
In addition , they have limited the right of people and groups to provide assistance to the voters who want to join .
These restrictions are not a result of this .
For example , during the general election of 2004 , the voters &apos; inclusion campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have fallen by 17 % of the number of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states to reduce the voting period in anticipation .
For example , during the general election of 2008 in Florida , 33 % of the voters who voted in anticipation were <unk> , while the latter were only 13 % of the state voters .
The same applies to the <unk> .
These were only 11 % of the voters , but 24 % of citizens voted in anticipation .
In return , the white white of 76 % of the electorate was only 46 % of the voters voting in anticipation .
Of course , the democrats and their supporters have opposed the adoption of laws restricting the inclusion of voters .
A number of legislative projects have been blocked by the vetoes of democrats .
The United States of America has spoken to suspend the most controversial laws .
They have been able to reduce the damage in part .
For example , only 16 on 34 states have adopted laws that require a identity card with photograph .
Nevertheless , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote in 2012 more difficult .
The democratic criticism of the laws which have been voted on and it is a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states .
A report from the <unk> Centre of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed to the electoral college to win the presidency .
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012 .
One thing , however , is certain : these new provisions will have a negative effect on the turnout .
In this respect , these measures are partly based on the American democratic system .
<unk> of prostate cancer : move the test or not ?
In fact , the test of <unk> would sometimes lead to the wrong results , with false negative results or false positive results , which lead to unnecessary medical interventions .
What is more to do with the people who are already reluctant to move from screening tests is to make it even more clear .
<unk> or not ?
We have asked for the opinion of two specialists .
In the studies carried out in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between witnesses , so it is difficult to interpret this data and have firm recommendations .
Another study , the European Union , has reached a difference in mortality between patients who have had screening and those who have not had them .
This study has also shown , with a follow-up after 12 years , that there are between 30 and 40 % more likely to have <unk> if we are not <unk> .
I therefore commend the test from 50 years , or from 40 years , if you have a direct parent which has already had prostate cancer .
<unk> people are also at risk .
The key is to take the right decision once we have detected a cancer .
There are aggressive cancers and others who are <unk> .
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of cancer , offering them the possible options , not necessarily dealing with prostate cancers that do not undermine the long-term life of the disease .
Today , many men who detect cancer will not be treated , because they are not being treated , because cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives .
We are going to suggest that they will be able to monitor active monitoring and , if the disease is making progress , they will be treated with treatment .
More and more , the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated .
I would therefore like to commend the test .
What is important , however , is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether or not it should be done .
In cooperation with the International Society of <unk> , <unk> has created a tool for assessing the test of the <unk> test .
The use of this document ( in English at the moment , a translation will be provided for a short time :
Preventing the disease
Unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer .
Despite the progress of research , the adoption of good life habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering .
It is estimated that , if everyone is in a good position , it would be possible to prevent 30 % of cancer .
If no one is going to <unk> , at least 50 % of this would be the case of the <unk> of the Canadian Cancer company .
On the other hand , it is estimated that around 10 % of cancers are caused by the <unk> .
There are also a number of things which are completely unexplained .
For the Canadian cancer company , the fight against smoking remains a priority , despite the reduction in the number of smokers .
Smoking is linked to 85 % of lung cancer .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This is a great deal of damage to people &apos;s health .
Even today , there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec , which is a matter of regret to the <unk> .
It is encouraging that 10 years after the abandonment of cigarette , the risk of dying of cancer is falling by half .
<unk>
<unk> and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease .
They are taking up the risk of breast cancer , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and cervical .
Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity in a whole life protects against cancer from <unk> , <unk> .
<unk>
The body is also recommending to restrict its consumption of red meat .
Too much of the risk of being achieved in the way of a <unk> cancer .
<unk> , too , should be avoided .
The conservation of meat by <unk> , <unk> or <unk> can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances .
The latter can damage the <unk> of the body and to lead to the development of cancer .
<unk>
In recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between <unk> and cancer .
However , their research is not conclusive for the moment .
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory , according to the <unk> .
While one of them has noted a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer , there is another point that has been made rather than an increase in the risk of cancer .
The effect of vitamin <unk> on cancer is not clearly established either .
On the other hand , Mr <unk> insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and family history with his doctor .
<unk> a screening test , it does not give cancer .
<unk> <unk>
The announcement of the likely discovery of the <unk> of <unk> has created a great deal of excitement , last summer , and the reason for this .
In fact , it is believed that this will be part of the European Union &apos;s responsibility for the mass of all things in the <unk> .
Then it is the last <unk> of the standard of the standard - our best , or &apos; less worse &apos; - of nature and the behaviour of the matter - but that has not yet been observed .
However , for the sake of the <unk> , it is not yet completely safe for us to do so .
There is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is a genuine new <unk> , and it is very much like the <unk> of <unk> predicted by the standard <unk> .
In addition , there is a need for further information that has been uncovered this week in a large congress of physical , Kyoto , and there is still a lack of data for it .
Let us assume that this is the case of the <unk> , since the chances of a mistake are too small , and what we are talking about .
At the same time , there is a law which is inevitable at the same time that two things cannot be done at the same time .
There is no way in which we can break down this rule , and do not try too much to do so .
Even if the physics of the particles is a very strange world , it is , too , a law of this kind : the principle of exclusion of <unk> , which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &apos; <unk> state &apos; - the &apos; state &apos; principle , which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time as they are in the same &apos; <unk> state &apos; .
In this respect , there is a question of the <unk> of particles .
In a corner , there are good people who have been appointed by the end of <unk> , who are entitled to the principle of <unk> .
On the other hand , the <unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> , which has no respect for nothing - in any case , not for this principle , which means that they can be in the same place , at the same time .
There are also two groups that are divided into two groups , according to the site ( absolutely extraordinary , elsewhere ) <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> , which we will not be discussing here , and the &apos; <unk> particles &apos; , by which the large forces of nature spread and to which the <unk> of <unk> would be in a way related .
This is something that should be stressed here , and this is something that is not all as exotic as possible .
In fact , if you are able to read this chronic , it is thanks to a <unk> of an extraordinary <unk> : <unk> , or &apos; <unk> &apos; which is the &apos; messenger &apos; of electromagnetic force .
When , in fact , a <unk> with an electric burden is accelerating or changing direction , it is a <unk> of the area of electromagnetic areas in this particular place , a bit like a <unk> launched in a <unk> .
This &apos; <unk> &apos; is born in the light of the light , or <unk> , or <unk> , etc . ) , and this line is nothing more than a <unk> - and therefore one of the <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; .
<unk>
The same applies to the <unk> of <unk> , that is to say that it is another area , the scope of the <unk> , which must be &apos; <unk> &apos; so that this <unk> will appear .
However , this scope is a great deal , much more stable than the electromagnetic area , and it is important to achieve a very great deal of energy , a little as if it was a frozen <unk> , just as a very great deal could <unk> the surface .
That is why we need a huge boost in the light of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The analogy with the electromagnetic scope is also useful to explain the report between <unk> and mass .
These are not all particles , or all materials , which interact with electromagnetic areas .
Some of them , such as magnets , do so , but others not - a paper of paper , for example , will never hold on ice on ice .
In the same way , it is not all particles that interact with the scope of <unk> : those that do so have a mass , while others , like <unk> , do not do so .
Now , what is the case of what is going to be done by means of all these research , and that is what Mrs <unk> is doing ?
For science , it serves to verify the validity of the standard standard ( <unk> ) , and it also allows the <unk> of <unk> to make any difference between the observations and predictions of the <unk> .
In fact , there are a number of people who wish to see it , because there is no difference in the way in which there can be any difference in the face of a &apos; new physics &apos; and to make some of the holes in the <unk> .
It has to be said that there are still huge shortcomings in this area , which does not propose any explanation for the seriousness ( <unk> ! ) or the dark area , which is about 80 % of the issue of <unk> ( <unk> ) .
However , there has been no such differences in the way to date .
<unk>
The impact of this research in the daily daily life of Mr <unk> , they are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no .
Let us take note of this : at the beginning of the 1960s , the pioneers of the <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , will not be in any way of the revolution that their work would trigger .
They are using scientific applications , but nothing else .
In fact , we have already said the <unk> <unk> - who worked in the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> was invented in 1960 , and he himself set up the first permanent <unk> ( the first were <unk> ) in 1962 , at the beginning of the <unk> was rather seen as a &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; .
Imagine if you were to be able to imagine this .
Then , the applications can come from the whole of the research .
For example , this same <unk> <unk> has developed a small light of light in 1969 , in the course of its work .
This <unk> , although it was not the original intention at all , is now used to look at all the <unk> of the world , and it has been given the Nobel Peace Prize .
This does not , of course , mean that the activities of the <unk> will necessarily turn our lives , but it means that it means that , really , we never know ...
palliative <unk> - the best way of dying ...
With its Commission dying in dignity , Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life .
The debate must take place in the near future , when a bill is being prepared .
In this important area , there is still a need to do so .
<unk> has tried to look at it more closely .
Just a few weeks ago , Mr <unk> was still in his <unk> .
The cancer of prostate cancer has left it for a two-year period .
&apos; They gave me five years to live , I made seven years &apos; , he said , <unk> <unk> , extended in his bed at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where he came on the eve .
However , it is always a shock , and it is not possible to prepare for it .
The disease is doing its work : a huge weakness that prevents it from making it alone , and even to eat them .
<unk> before a lunch lunch , he accepts that he will be able to help to eat it .
<unk> , they are even smile , talking to the unknown people who are <unk> around him , they give him their medicines .
The courage of ordinary death .
I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that it is humiliating <unk> and <unk> .
A few hours later , the &apos; team has found a remedy to this evil .
In our lives , we are learning that a man , who is standing up &apos; , tell us Pierre <unk> , a psychologist at the <unk> house .
<unk> at the stage of the child , for some people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
It is dependent on the ability of the person to accept a step backwards , <unk> .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people who are working in palliative care , there are great times at the heart of this step .
Patients entering the home of palliative care are suffering from cancer .
They have a prediction for maximum life for three months .
At this stage , the &apos; doctors of doctors and nurses around them are no longer sure &apos; <unk> &apos; .
For Mrs <unk> 89 , 89 years ago , the worst fear is to die &apos; aware and <unk> &apos; .
However , the disease has come to light with my children .
I have good children &apos; , <unk> .
&quot; I have no more wishes in life &apos; , let us say , before we accept that he is being given a mask to help him breathe .
In the next few days , it is waiting for a further visit to his son from Italy .
In <unk> , a voluntary group is being made available , with a voluntary group , with the care of the body .
These are palliative care , which is given when there is nothing else to do .
In order to make death more comfortable .
In Quebec , there is a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants .
It is very little when we know that all of us will end up dying one day .
Here , the life is continuing in the best possible conditions , explaining the <unk> <unk> <unk> , one of the doctors in the house .
It is both physical , emotional or spiritual .
In the way of dying , it will be accepted by means of care to <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> will no longer be obliged to control their sugar rates .
The death penalty is a daily one .
Last night , a beer was used for Mr X , who died in the last night .
This morning , it is his son who will end beer with a <unk> .
We are helping to help the relatives of the same way as patients &apos; , let us say that they are <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> house , there are no more than a few days ago .
With an old <unk> man who <unk> his last family assembly in the court , <unk> in his <unk> , while he was in honour , a young man of 36 years dying tragically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , having tried to survive .
For the last six months , there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer of less than 45 years of age , which is concerned about <unk> <unk> <unk> .
53 % of patients who are admitted to the <unk> house come from their homes , 47 % from the hospital .
<unk> care
It is said that 77 % of the Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care , that is to say , care designed to allay the suffering when a patient has reached the final phase of his life , whether at home , hospital or home care .
A number of bodies , such as the <unk> house and the <unk> <unk> of the High Montreal , will become more or less exclusively in the care of cancer .
It is precisely this great shortcoming in <unk> health care , which is causing a fear of a number of specialist doctors in the way of the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and the <unk> suicide .
Since October , there has been a manifesto , signed by <unk> of palliative care , which Dr <unk> <unk> and Dr Bernard <unk> and Dr Bernard <unk> have been circulating to show .
According to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will have good palliative care before we accept euthanasia .
Recently , I have said that I have seen a patient to spend 14 days on the matter of urgency , with great pain , without making the necessary effort to relieve them .
I am afraid that patients are asking to die because they do not receive adequate care .
At the same time , there are a number of <unk> on their patients to the last day , despite the worst forecasts .
The hopes of the survival of Richard Richard were already minimal when he has abandoned a <unk> <unk> .
When I announced to my <unk> that I would like to deal with the treatment , she replied to me that she was sorry that I stop fighting , he said .
However , he told me that I was over .
No care of care
<unk> <unk> believes that 90 % of the people who are asking to die for their own carers who have not been given their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative team .
It must be said , however , that palliative care is not absolutely <unk> in the treatment of pain .
According to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of palliative care for the <unk> care company of the Grand Montreal , patients would be opposed to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the end of the life , doctors often use the palliative <unk> , which is tantamount to the <unk> of the patient until their death , or in a sporadic manner , or permanently .
We can no longer pretend that we should not hear this <unk> of suffering .
More and more , the <unk> patient will be able to have the opportunity to have this palliative <unk> .
The people who are not relieved always say the same sentence : &apos; I want to die .
However , this does not necessarily mean &apos; I want you to say &apos; I want to say &apos; I want to be relieved &apos; .
This report has been made possible by means of a tax exchange exchange exchange exchange exchange .
<unk> property
<unk> officials , <unk> entrepreneurs , political parties and the Italian mafia of the Italian mafia tell us day on a daily basis what they know about a wonderful &apos; system &apos; , <unk> industry , officials , politicians , trade unionists and <unk> .
A &apos; industry &apos; that has cost the taxpayer , especially in the 1990s and in 2000 , which has cost a great deal of money .
It is curious to say that the system has collapsed since the great means &apos; , <unk> Jacques <unk> , a Member of Quebec and former police leader in Montreal .
It was by him that the scandal broke out in 2011 , through a thorough investigation into the <unk> of road work contracts in Quebec , which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time , Jean <unk> , had made only a step backwards .
The &apos; <unk> report &apos; established a direct link between the industry , the hidden funding of parties and corruption of officials .
Since the start of the investigation in 2010 , the only Ministry of Transport would have saved USD 1 billion on contracts &apos; , some of which were <unk> their instincts in order to reach a share .
The Commission &apos; s &apos; has already taken two mayors &apos; , <unk> , and the hope that it will be able to achieve &apos; demonstrate the <unk> behind individuals &apos; .
A permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit , which was created in 2011 , is also working with its army of auditors , investigators and analysts .
The more <unk> the <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; who , since 2009 , would have led the Montreal cartel to put it back to the <unk> of contracts ...
Over the past few weeks , it has carried out a series of <unk> and accusations for fraud and corruption against local representatives , such as Frank <unk> and Richard <unk> , mayor of a city of <unk> .
The next on the list would be Gilles <unk> , who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval , the third city of Quebec .
It is suspected that there is a repetition of bribes in exchange for public contracts .
There are formally accused engineers in Montreal and from Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The latter has led to a feeling by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the &apos; system &apos; .
For years , it has paid for 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal , which is an intermediary of the mafia , which is linked to the mafia , which is <unk> the money to the Montreal Party , the Mayor <unk> <unk> .
Mr <unk> has caused all winds in the years 2000 , giving more than USD 88 000 ( around EUR 68 000 ) to provincial parties , especially the Liberals .
It would also be a question of having organised illegal funds for the Liberal Minister , Mr <unk> <unk> .
<unk> contracts ,
In Montreal , the &apos; system &apos; of corruption was used to work <unk> .
Mr <unk> , <unk> in public work , has done so well before the committee : in ten years &apos; time , it has received <unk> companies , invitations to travel , golf <unk> , in exchange for sewage contracts that he will cost .
Other <unk> officials have declared themselves to be <unk> by <unk> by 30 % to 40 % of invoices , with false <unk> .
Then there was a party of the Mayor , Martin <unk> , who accused Mr <unk> of having deliberately closed a blind eye to a parallel budget that is fuelling their coffers with dirty money .
As a result of these revelations , Mr <unk> has resigned at the beginning of November , in a major crisis .
<unk> <unk> was one of the first elected representatives of Montreal .
<unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , in the east of the island , is protesting in 2010 against the sale of a local local ground that is bought USD 5 million and <unk> ... 1.6 million to promoters , at the same time in the area of the property boom .
70 % of dirty money in campaigns
In the end of the investigation which will finally be put in place , it says that it is &apos; draw up a thread for understanding the functioning of the system , <unk> by <unk> , to stop the <unk> and point of order &apos; .
The process is a painful and positive one .
It is a problem that is cleaning up , but there should be a single investigation unit in Montreal and on the eve of this , so not to see the dubious practices .
As it is done , it is being done .
It is a matter of urgency .
Jacques <unk> notes that &apos; officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars &apos; , but , above all , are concerned about the role of &apos; elected elected representatives &apos; , when they do not <unk> in the <unk> !
By 70 % of the dirty money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec , he would <unk> : &apos; I was told that it was only a poor reflection of reality .
The <unk> Government proposes to limit the donations to parties on 100 dollars , but it will not change the fact that , as long as it is not restricted to electoral expenditure , there will be dirty money in politics .
He advocates a complete revision of the system for granting public contracts and financing of parties : &apos; We cannot go down ; go to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to rebuild the house on a more solid basis , with more controls and laws .
If this history is to undermine the international image of Quebec and Montreal , Mr <unk> calls on those who laugh to look at their own court ...
<unk> is not the <unk> <unk>
This season has taken up to a new extent with the <unk> .
How do you explain this progress ?
It can be explained by individual awareness and also by the new dimension of the <unk> .
Large players have arrived .
Every day , I am making progress on their side .
I also have a great deal to do with the technical staff .
On a daily basis , I am giving rise to this point .
At the same time , it is easier to do so .
It is very quickly in football .
However , I am not going to go on .
At the beginning of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , I have been in the middle of <unk> .
So you are taking advantage of the competition that has been established by Carlo <unk> .
This summer &apos;s recruits is used to be used to argue at a very high level .
They also know that every training is crucial .
What is meant to be said is that a player like me is keen to face up to and provide the maximum .
On the other hand , Carlo <unk> gives me a great deal of interest in my position .
It is supported by assistants such as Claude <unk> , who was in the same position as me .
Is it a man who is in the position of the situation ?
Of course , of course .
It is inspired by all the technicians .
Today , it is not equal in League 1 and is one of the best European trainers .
It has a great deal of experience and has gained a lot of titles with <unk> clubs .
He has made great players .
I believe that it will win in Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I would then like to see a number of injuries .
The confidence that it gives me also explains my performance .
What look at the first part of the <unk> season ?
In League 1 , Lyon has taken the place of leader .
However , we are still going to take place .
One of our major objectives is the League of Liberals : we have been qualified for the final <unk> with the way in which we are .
What is the aim of the club in this competition ?
We are going to try to go as far as possible .
From now on .
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams .
First of all , we want to end our chicken , in front of Porto , in order to be able to receive during the eighth return .
Can it become a great European club in the short term ?
It has already been the budget ...
In order to become a great European club , Paris needs to win securities and be in the long term .
Today , this is not the case .
<unk> , the <unk> is given the means for this project to be achieved .
In League 1 , does not win the title , like the last season , would be a major failure ?
Of course , this would be a great disappointment .
In this year , we really have a great deal of heart to pocket .
The last season has not gone far .
In May there was disappointment , because we had the qualities of the first .
A great deal of season has been made .
We have completed 79 points .
Normally , with 79 points , it is supposed to be champion ...
But another team , <unk> , has carried out an even more fantastic season .
This year , I believe that this is the right thing .
Even if the large teams such as Marseilles , Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title , I think we have weapons to prevail .
Do you think that the media are waiting too much from the <unk> ?
It is right that we should wait for a great deal of us in the light of what has been invested and players who have been invested in the world .
This is something that is fully accepted .
After , when we win <unk> at home against <unk> and there are still things to blame us , that is a little frustrating .
There is a question of what people expect from more .
It will never be possible to win every weekend .
It is not a question of Barcelona .
There is an attempt to set up a game .
A team is built with time .
It has been proved in the League of champions that we could be able to respond .
Look at Manchester City , which has not come , for two seasons to be called for the final <unk> , they have also made huge expenditure !
In view of the money invested , you were thought with 15 points in advance .
That was to neglect our opponents and the French championship .
Lyon and Marseille , which were not the last season , were &apos; <unk> &apos; by this new <unk> .
This shows that there is an exciting one of the League .
I hope that in May we will be able to smile by telling us that , despite all the difficulties , it has ended up .
<unk> seems to be totally dependent on <unk> <unk> .
It is much better to say that there is a &apos; <unk> dependence &apos; .
This means that <unk> is very successful and that it puts a great deal of aims .
It has come for that , and it shows that it is the <unk> of League 1 .
It has demonstrated wherever it has happened that he was a great player , a global <unk> .
In the group , we respect human beings and player .
He also respects the men he has around him .
What he has done is really exceptional .
This will lead to the others at their level .
<unk> Silva , who is one of the best defenders of the world , also allows everyone to make progress .
How have you experienced Euro 2012 with the French team ?
As a disappointment .
I had to take part in the euro .
Unfortunately , I have been unable to get away from the point of time .
I have seen things there and I have been strengthened .
Today , I am going to make good selection matches .
That was what I had hoped for since my <unk> with the <unk> .
We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine and we must now have exemplary behaviour .
What kind of look at the first few months of Mr <unk> at the head of the <unk> ?
He has achieved the results of the report .
It is well placed in the name of the United Kingdom in the name of the world .
<unk> is rigorous , which is close to the players , and it is a good one .
As was the case of Laurent <unk> , as was the case of Mr <unk> .
However , I do not want to make a comparison .
The White Paper has reached its goal as a result of the euro .
I hope that Mr <unk> will lead to the <unk> in Brazil .
Is it a founding match in Spain on 16 October .
This match has given us confidence .
Everyone has fought for everyone .
Before this shock in Spain , I had never experienced a match in my career .
With <unk> , pay and sale without the banks
Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange , based on central banks , identified transactions and treatment costs between stakeholders .
Moreover , as often in these technologies , a political vision is tangible : the conviction that the current monetary system is making up banking monopolies , leading to financial crises .
In fact , <unk> , invented by <unk> <unk> ( a <unk> ) , is both a virtual currency ( but <unk> in dollars , euro ... ) and a secure exchange protocol to the way in which the exchange of <unk> files can be exchanged .
Around 200 000 transactions have already been registered through 15 000 computers on the network .
A small thousand websites accept <unk> as a gift or a means of payment .
The course of the <unk> , after having reached a summit of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , has fallen to 2 dollars , five months later , before coming back today around a dozen dollars ( the courses are recorded on the <unk> site ) .
There is nothing very impressive , compared with world trade in real currency or financial products .
However , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has been interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October .
It describes <unk> as &apos; virtual currency with the greatest success &apos; , &apos; compete with the dollar or the euro &apos; and &apos; similar to conventional currencies &apos; .
<unk> from other types of virtual currency such as &apos; loans &apos; , used to make progress in a video game , which is being won by playing or that one can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system .
However , each time there is a central authority on trade and trade .
Together with <unk> , all the <unk> of the network are both governed by the book of accounts , auditors and issuers of currency , and buyers and sellers .
How does this network work ?
Every transaction between two users is in reality between two electronic addresses to the way of an e-mail .
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment , thus ensuring anonymity .
A package of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a dual encryption system .
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction .
Thanks to the content of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the <unk> trade in public accounts , broadcast throughout the whole network , is available .
<unk> is to write this new transaction in the book .
It is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers , and the winner of which is a temporary central banker , will have the privilege of adding this additional line .
This is a phase of the file , that is to say , the transformation of a large file in a digital footprint .
The computers &apos; computers take the new transaction and add a number before &apos; <unk> &apos; .
The aim is to find the number that gives a special footprint ( many <unk> at the beginning ) .
Once this number has been found , the others will be aware that this is the right one .
The transaction is then linked to the chain of all other transactions ; any change would change the footprint .
If , in order to fraud , a user wanted to pay twice with the same money ( less than ten minutes ) , one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining , because the two have different fingerprints .
The computer which has been resolved with the challenge of the European Union has taken 50 <unk> .
In order to avoid inflation , this reward is divided by two regularly , probably before the end of 2012 .
The number of <unk> in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are <unk> up to 100 <unk> , which leaves room for the margin ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also being raised by the increase in the power of calculation .
The life of the network has already been high and low .
<unk> websites providing services for <unk> have been attacked and stolen <unk> .
It is not a question of the protocol itself &apos; .
The ECB is also aware of the possibilities for money laundering through this anonymous service .
However , it also has this shortcoming .
As a result of such as <unk> , there is no reason for this .
Others , such as the <unk> <unk> platform , accept them .
Recently , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Institute in Israel , analysed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80 % of the <unk> are not circulating .
In November , there was a great deal of &apos; <unk> balances &apos; .
<unk> USD 30 000 have been exchanged &apos; , and it welcomes <unk> <unk> , who is working for <unk> , which has to have <unk> <unk> .
Pierre <unk> , as the author of an educational book on this currency , believes a great deal of the potential of this technology as a network of transactions .
His system , <unk> , is equivalent to a credit card ( true currency ) or a mobile payment without contact , but it uses <unk> to validate transactions , which is thus cheaper .
It is a matter of greater identity and can therefore be anonymous .
The system is easy to implement among traders , who do not need to install new terminals or software .
It is only enough to communicate with a telephone , and a telephone may be able to recognise &apos; <unk> and recognise &apos; , Mr <unk> <unk> , who has thousands of users .
There is a general movement in calling into question the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems .
<unk> will take time for <unk> to be required , but 2013 could be a turning point .
The ECB , in its report , provides for a review of the different risks , which are now considered to be high , in the event of the success of this currency .
We have come from Afghanistan .
After all , then , after all ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( <unk> and <unk> ) .
NATO and the Americans should follow the end of 2014 .
It is time for the Afghan army to take over its territory and that the Afghans choose their future , without waiting for us .
It is the Afghan farmers who have been punished in particular , and they have been punished as terrorists .
We ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , are killed and injured .
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists , former leaders in Pakistan , but often farmers who reject the foreign armed presence , like the Soviets .
They want to defend their traditions , old and archaic , even if they were joined by <unk> , Pakistani , Arab , Uzbek , <unk> .
<unk> , sometimes helped by the local insurgents , will no longer be able to do so when the West will become more discreet .
The departure of the French troops from the <unk> base , which I have seen from the <unk> <unk> thanks to French funds , has been in order .
<unk> and tanks have joined Kabul without being attacked , <unk> by helicopters .
There will be no flood of the Taliban in Kabul at the end of 2014 .
The circumstances have changed since the fact that they have been made in 1994 in 1994 .
In Kabul , it was empty , the fire and blood of the various factions .
They have then been seen as a kind of liberation , a return to security .
The Afghan people have paid the price of obscurantism of these <unk> farmers by the organisation of al-Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
<unk> <unk> , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are joined in the desire to keep women in a lower position .
The main significant point of the <unk> war has returned to power in 2001 .
They have taken up in <unk> , taking part in government land to sell them into land to build refugees from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from &apos; huge American <unk> contracts .
They have <unk> themselves ; most of them have not fought for themselves .
The people , as I have heard in the countryside , aspire to a government that is not set up of thieves .
Many young people want to leave , as will those who have been able to take advantage of the United States &apos; <unk> , and that is a great deal of money .
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies .
They have <unk> the modern world in their <unk> in Iran or in Pakistan , and they have appreciated the benefits .
Around 65 % of the population has fewer than 25 years old ; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants , one fifth of the total population .
In cities , government schools are full , and girls and girls .
It will be necessary to provide work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders .
All of them , including armed opponents , are <unk> from mobile phones ; television , and its Turkish <unk> , is being followed everywhere .
The army is now present .
Will the authorities be considered to be regarded as legitimate .
It is a matter of concern for former <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , who will be able to recover from the point of view of central power .
Afghanistan , a mountain country , the strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation , as well as the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralised state , to be able to be strong , removing the post of Prime Minister who existed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls , especially in the run-up to the elections in April 2014 .
However , since the 1950s , it has been dependent on foreign aid , which is dependent on foreign aid .
No industry has been put into place , and there is no dam of any kind , and there is no need for an important irrigation system .
Everything is imported , but nothing is produced , except fruit and vegetables .
Priority is given to private initiative .
In a country that has been ruined by thirty years of war , government control on infrastructure would have been necessary .
Noise has been widespread that there has been a great deal of mining .
This has only been added to the feeling that the West is in favour of the fact that the West is here in order to do so .
Without energy to deal with iron ore or copper on the ground , there is no means of transport to be able to export it through the mountains , there is no mining mining .
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine from my <unk> , leaving the international <unk> to the World Bank ( funded by the World Bank ) to search for the huge <unk> site and remain the most important employers in the province .
One day , we will also have to see that Afghanistan and Pakistan , which are very much dependent on imports and exports , will restore normal reports .
The start of the French armed troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls of girls , boys , French Department of French University , the French Institute , cooperation in military , legal , medical and agricultural areas , support for the archaeological delegation .
Since 2009 , in order to try to &apos; win the hearts and minds &apos; and to carry out the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions into line , a service of &apos; civil-military action &apos; of the Ministry of Defence ( <unk> ) , removed in 2012 , has led to a great deal with a small French NGO and agricultural rehabilitation work in dozens of mountain villages .
This work , which has been <unk> into local work , has been able to help to contain the uprising : irrigation , sinks , drinking water , reforestation , fruit trees , soil protection and the increase in arable land .
What are we going to remember , after EUR 2 billion of military expenditure ?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions , which are very tough in these valleys , which are often more than 2 000 metres .
The embassy received dozens of written requests from local communities from local communities in the province of <unk> .
In order for them to be released from the uprising carried out by foreign groups , what the farmers have said to me would be to be able to keep them in favour of a small civil aid , and that is something that is directly controlled by them .
A constitution that has been carried out in Egypt
This is a new poker blow for President Mohammed <unk> .
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , it has decided to play its part .
With everyone in the short , he announced , on Wednesday , that the constituent House will vote on its final text .
Just a week ago , the Head of State had given the House another two months to finish his work .
It is soon two years since Egypt is based on a provisional text , which has been amended on a number of times , which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal <unk> .
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country .
For his opponents , the President is persisting in his &apos; autocratic <unk> &apos; , continuing to &apos; <unk> his word &apos; and &apos; <unk> the law &apos; .
On behalf of its supporters , it is a means of ending up with the institutional and political crisis , speeding up the transition process .
A referendum should be held in the fifteen days &apos; time .
A very short period of time which obliges the Brotherhood to renounce their draft to explain the text , article by article , to the <unk> .
For the President , it is also a way of finding a popular and democratic legitimacy when there is a conflict in the whole country .
Mohammed <unk> seems to be convinced that the <unk> will be voting in favour , as he said in an interview in the US weekly weekly .
All the same as this use of an hasty vote is of the ultimatum to the Egyptian people : &apos; Either you vote for my text , or I am keeping the full powers &apos; , they are supposed to end up after the adoption of the Constitution .
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent House , by a large Islamic majority , voted in favour of the text yesterday .
Most of the liberals have been missing from the call .
<unk> , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had <unk> the door , believing that he was unable to assert their views .
The representatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society did so .
In order to ensure that the necessary quorum is to be achieved , 11 people , who are <unk> , have been added to the haste , yesterday morning .
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood .
Without surprise , it is the most often unanimous that the articles have been voted on .
There were commentators who <unk> the fact that one of the only differences of the day has been expressed around ... Question Time , some members of the committee believe that the constituent of the constituent was badly resolved .
The text , which was still in the process of being voted on yesterday evening , includes a number of articles .
<unk> all the attention , Article 2 remains the same as the 1971 Constitution , which states that &apos; Sharia principles are the main source of law &apos; .
The <unk> parties , for whom the &apos; establishment of Islamic law is a major demand , expected to be able to replace &apos; the principles &apos; by &apos; the rules &apos; , which would have allowed stricter application .
For the Islamists , the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society .
<unk> &apos; , as the Liberals do not see it is a communication .
It is because of their opinion that the Islamisation of the Constitution is being carried out through other articles .
In particular , they are aimed at Article 220 , which gives the <unk> University an advisory role , particularly as far as it is concerned , in order to verify compliance with Sharia law .
According to Egypt &apos;s specialist <unk> <unk> , this is worrying because &apos; the people who are called has not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
It can be seen from the beginnings of a theocracy &apos; .
In addition , the concerns of the Liberals are being <unk> by the fact that the next <unk> of this university should be much less moderate than the present .
At the moment , there is no concrete religious involvement .
With this Constitution , we are still in the civil state .
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not <unk> but academics , for some trained in the French system &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> , who is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition .
However , it recognises &apos; that there can be a ambiguity around Article 220 , because the words employed in religious vocabulary .
Reference is made to &apos; <unk> &apos; in particular , in particular , in the case of Islamic law , which is the case of Islamic law .
The question could be the question of how much civil judges are responsible for their opinion .
In addition to its religious aspect , the text adopted yesterday is very critical because of the extensive powers that it attaches to the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Brotherhood is saying that they are significantly reduced in comparison with what they were under the old regime .
Another contentious point is the powers conferred on the army .
In accordance with the desire of the military , the defence budget will not be subject to Parliament , but to a national defence council .
Nor will civil rights trials be banned in military courts , as requested by human rights associations .
The latter also share their concerns about the text , which they consider to be civil .
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and an insult is now being banned , which may have serious consequences for freedom of expression , in particular .
In addition , there is no longer any article of the protection of women , in the case of the protection of women , in the case of Human Rights Watch .
In his opinion , the only positive thing is the ban on torture under Article 36 .
The word was not included in the previous Constitution .
While the Egyptian President had to speak yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned this afternoon .
The support of the Head of State of State <unk> on Saturday .
In Israel , <unk> places , the World Centre and a sea of <unk> are waiting for tourists
There is a great deal of biblical truths in the Earth , and the <unk> of the world &apos;s comfort and a wild nature .

The old beliefs want to have the mountain of the mountain .
<unk> museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country .
It is not possible to visit them in a single stay .
These are the most interesting five most interesting .
First of all , the <unk> Museum of Israel , which is close to the Knesset , is close to the <unk> .
It is up to the old <unk> of <unk> , or in the <unk> Sea , discovered in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , as well as almost 500 miles of archaeological and <unk> objects .

There is no doubt about this in complete darkness .
<unk> stars .

Ukraine is also mentioned in this area .
Health and health
The three major <unk> stations of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea , the Red Sea and the <unk> Sea .
Each of them is <unk> , water parks , <unk> and <unk> .
It should be noted that you will swim in the Red Sea even the winter , because water temperature does not fall below 21 , while air can reach 23 ° .
The <unk> Sea is even more hot and you can swim throughout the whole year .
On the other hand , it is the most single sea in the world : it is at the lowest level of the Earth , or <unk> me below the sea level .
<unk> water contains <unk> and is very easy to do , even those who do not know to swim .
There is a surreal beauty of the landscape .

<unk> secrets
The old city of Tel Aviv is being kept on the brink of the Mediterranean Sea .
It is being crossed by the famous <unk> , linking Egypt , Syria , Anatolia and Mesopotamia .
The city is mentioned in Greek and Egyptian <unk> .
According to the myth , it is here that <unk> has built his <unk> and that <unk> has saved the beautiful <unk> , with whom he has been in a long and happy life .
It is very much in favour of tourists to go to the close of the <unk> .
It is said that , if you get to the streets of the streets in line with &apos; your &apos; your &apos; your &apos; sign , the fate will <unk> .
In <unk> , you will be able to sit down to the people who have been able to make the <unk> sittings of all Israel and other countries .
In <unk> , the city of King <unk> , you will be able to go on in the Roman theatre , to conquer the fortress of <unk> .
Under the Roman Empire , <unk> was the main city of <unk> and the residence of the Roman prosecutors , including Pontius Pilate .

If you are to leave for Israel , you do not worry about your English : about 30 % of the population is talking about Russian .
For your trip , it is better for the euro to be used for the euro , because they are easily traded by <unk> ( today 1 dollar dollar .
As far as urban transport is concerned , it is mainly buses , but Jerusalem is equipped with a rapid tram and Haifa has the country &apos;s only underground line , consisting of six stations and able to link the poor and high city .
It is almost an underground <unk> .
The journey in all types of transport in common cost costs 6 <unk> and will make it possible to make changes in <unk> .
In Israel , the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate on Saturday .
On Saturday evening , on Saturday evening , in the sun , the markets , the shops and public transport are not going to continue .
The working week is beginning on Sunday morning .
Many <unk> , restaurants and hotels only serve <unk> food , which excludes pigs , the fruit of sea , fish without <unk> and the <unk> of milk and meat .

The language of the figures
Three million tourists around the world have visited Israel in 2012 .
Above all , it was the case of people who have come to travel and rest in the United States , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England and Ukraine .
<unk> miles from Ukrainian tourists visited the Earth from January to October 2012 , 51 % more than in 2010 , before visa cancellation on 9 February 2011 .
<unk> , in Moscow &apos; s &apos; language &apos; : migrants save money
While Members and human rights activists are <unk> on what is going to give the law on the compulsory language test , fraudsters selling &apos; false &apos; certificates have already appeared in the country .
Every year , 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow , St Petersburg and other Russian cities .
Most of the time , it is Central Asia nationals : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
The sole aim of this is to win money in order to help their families .
Since 1 December , a law has entered into force and states that every migrant worker will have to go through a Russian review .
At the moment , this rule only concerns those who intend to work in the services sector , housing , private services and retail sales .
However , with time , it promises that the Federal Migration Service , the tests will become compulsory for all immigrants .
In addition , we need to validate the knowledge of language , but also of the history of Russia and the foundations of the law .
It will be necessary to validate his linguistic knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew their work .
Only the nationals of the countries where Russian citizens have an official language status is free .
People who have obtained certificates or education diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law either .
<unk> and the protection of rights
The network of review centres will be under the aegis of the Russian Institute of language <unk> , the University of friendship of the peoples , the State of State in Moscow , the State of State of St Petersburg and other foreign education institutions .
Immigrants will be able to carry out the examinations in all the cities of the country : more than 160 centres have already been opened across the entire territory .
This initiative has been supported by the members of the Duma of the State of State and the Federal Migration Service .
Before the law enters into force , however , the defenders of human rights have already been asked on many occasions in the press : what is it going to give ?
What is the question of the need for Russia to change to the Russians and the Russians ?
First of all , it will be possible to reduce the number of people who are suffering &apos; slave labour &apos; .
Many talk about the defence of the rights of migrant workers , which explains the director of the Russian Federal Service Office in Tajikistan , Victor <unk> .
The protection of rights must begin before the start .
Only a selected selection system will help to resolve the problems of foreign workers by 90 % .
There are problems for migrants without a profession , without training , and those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates .
Without the understanding of language , <unk> <unk> , the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who , on the pretext of helping him , will provide a &apos; travel &apos; in a overcrowded <unk> where he and the dozens of his fellow people are <unk> for months without food and paper and will have to <unk> between 12 and 14 hours a day .
There are many complaints from our migrants .
<unk> , they are promised one thing , and when they arrive , they are mistaken , they are taking their passport , and they do not affect the expected salary &apos; , confirms the <unk> of the Migration Service for the work of Tajikistan , <unk> <unk> .
I would like to say that I would like to ask you , Mr police !
However , many of the nationals of Central Asian republics who want to earn money in Russia would give them money that they do not only know the language of the country where they wish to go , but also to write with difficulty in their own language .
It is , of course , not their fault , but their misfortune : there is little of the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , can afford to follow up with a primary primary education .
Indeed , their families do not even have to feed their children without talking about them properly and to equip them for schools .
As soon as they arrive at <unk> , these young people are going to earn money as soon as possible .
It is difficult if we do not know the language , <unk> .
You have been cut down and weakened .
The human rights defenders , however , take note of an important aspect of the law on language .
There will be no doubt about the fact that there will be a legal status for migrants .
Without status , there will be no official examination or work later .
However , most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia .
<unk> and defence
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia .
The reason for this is that there is a need for administrative obstacles to be given .
In addition , it is costing money : between 12 and 16 miles .
Then we can get a false record to the tune of only 1 500 <unk> .
Russian policemen know that we have false documents , so that we do not have any registration , and that is why there is no registration .
They are asking for 100 , 200 <unk> , and what is to be bought from cigarettes , of tea &apos; .
<unk> quickly , let us not <unk> and <unk> a great deal of art
From the first day of the entry into force of the language law , it was discovered that migrants &apos; registration papers were not the only ones to be false .
A number of false languages of language examinations have already been confiscated by the staff of the Federal Service of Migration .
<unk> papers are outside the ordinary colour .
Of course , their new owners have not had them for nothing : every migrant who was hoping to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand <unk> for this document .
It is twice and a half times more than the official procedure : it will cost migrant workers three thousand <unk> .
Representatives of the power and the defenders of human rights agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to make it impossible simply to buy these paper .
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first blow .
In addition , immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating people .
The Ministry of Home Affairs is not dealing with the market .
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low .
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tighten up the law against civil arms operators .
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents : whether they are the attacks on marriages or the killing organised by the Moscow lawyer <unk> <unk> , who died .
The police wants to ban the port of rubber arms in public places and meet the legal age of obtaining the licence for the port of weapon by passing from 18 to 21 years .
The idea has been supported by the head of the Committee on Security and Defence Policy , <unk> <unk> who promised that the amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Duma shortly .
Everyone is not satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem with &apos; <unk> &apos; .
There has been an open letter on the Internet in which its authors , representatives of various fire centres , require to abandon &apos; this senseless <unk> &apos; .
The percentage of crimes committed with a weapon registered is minimal , said in the Russian service <unk> <unk> , a lawyer and specialist for the BBC .
According to the <unk> statistics on a period of six months in 2012 , 142 crimes have been committed with a <unk> weapon in police services while <unk> 000 crimes have been registered in the same period .
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening the laws on civil weapons will not prevent criminals from supplying to the black market .
According to them , we can find any weapon in Moscow today for a reasonable price .
However , the Ministry of the Interior states that he is monitoring the dissemination of illegal weapons .
suppliers :
The black market in arms is provided through several channels .
The main channels are five , by <unk> <unk> , Colonel <unk> , who has been used for ten years to the Ministry of Education and General <unk> .
<unk> from a site in order
The first is &apos; military sign &apos; , in other words , the weapons that have been stolen during military operations in the Caucasus .
These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers , but also by the <unk> &apos; .
The second type of weapons from the black market are those that are being used by criminals to the law .
Let us explain that this is also about the weapons stolen in the police stocks as well as those who are directly affected by the representatives of the forces of order .
Illegal <unk> are going to sell from military warehouses .
Many of them have often suffered in explosions .
There are some versions which indicate that some fires have been triggered in order to conceal the deficit &apos; , which explains the former military .
In the case of <unk> , arms manufacturers are in favour of something .
There are private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market , particularly in Moscow &apos; , tell an expert .
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling .
A large number of <unk> and <unk> come from poor countries , such as Kyrgyzstan .
There is local production , sometimes small-scale , a mafia which has been formed and organises the supply of the former military .
Where are the arms coming from ?
Experts have assessed the amount of illegal arms on the black market .
A report on the issue was set up in 2011 by the Centre for the analysis of the problems and study for public administration .
Experts have analysed the reports by the Ministry of the Interior and <unk> , criminal issues and the public data on arms .
The vast majority of illegal weapons , as a result of the fact , explain to researchers , from the army and of the forces .
Half of the weapons in the black market have been found to be the fault of the employees whose work is linked to arms , <unk> in the report .
According to researchers , 17 % of weapons come from military conflicts , 14 % are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5 % are from &apos; illegal searches &apos; .
A seller and consulting a <unk> who asked to keep anonymity ensures that no one is buying the weapons found by these <unk> specialists ; they are too old .
More often , in his view , sellers are going to look for new goods in military warehouses .
The person is buying up by means of unity , for example a <unk> <unk> .
It has been published by a <unk> .
It is to be transported in the city and it will be used for 900 <unk> by the unity with two chargers .
&quot; It is true that the police is aware of all cases , so when crimes are on the point of being clarified , it is making a purchase of control by illegal arms dealers &apos; , adds the seller .
As in a luxury shop &apos;
The seller and the purchaser are usually through knowledge .
I have consulted sites , blogs , until a type is evident and I propose to come to the <unk> station where someone has become me in a &apos; corner &apos; for bargaining .
The price of the <unk> , I have been given to me on the spot .
Victor <unk> observer
In order to find a <unk> , I have to know someone who has contact , explain the seller , and I know someone , but I do not trust him .
There are sellers in the markets , but there is also a need to come from such a person , for example , from such a person , who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth &apos; .
Now , I am buying a hand of American <unk> with someone who I trust .
It is only to me because he knows that I will not give it .
Small new ones are seeking arms in different ways .
The former military Victor <unk> tried as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject .
In his opinion , there has been no change in the models .
He was given a <unk> photograph in which he had &apos; everything we want &apos; .
I thought I was in a luxury shop &apos; , remember the military .
There is no secret for the buyer , and it is a case of <unk> , we can try to do everything .
As a potential customer , I am not just buying , we are going with the seller in the forest and a target .
I am allowed to be given and when I am convinced that the weapon is going well , we are beginning to negotiate &apos; , described the expert .
<unk> of a shop .
Research engines have sites and groups on <unk> where we can buy weapons for different uses .
To do so , there is no need for any document and no one to meet .
It is enough to have a precise amount of money &apos; , <unk> on advertising on the site &apos; <unk> a <unk> or a <unk> &apos; .
The users are asking for them and ask questions .
And is it being sold to minors ?
<unk> , of course &apos; , calls for the user &apos; Ivan &apos; ( <unk> <unk> )
<unk> <unk> in Moscow &apos; , written &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; in its very direct request .
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of false sites and <unk> people who want to buy arms weapons .
People are <unk> on food as hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in coal .
<unk> <unk> , observer and former <unk>
I have heard about this type of model : generally , the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws .
People are taking orders .
It is the case that the purchaser is making the payment of the <unk> .
&quot; He receives a photograph and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden &apos; , explains the Secretary of the &apos; Law to a <unk> &apos; , <unk> <unk> .
Victor <unk> says that by making a request on the site , we can be able to find a weapon and behind bars .
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of false sites and <unk> people who want to buy arms weapons .
&apos;The people are <unk> on food as hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia &apos; .
<unk> <unk>
The purchase of an illegal firearms , the experts , can cost between 100 and 900 dollars .
According to <unk> <unk> of the &apos; Law to a weapon &apos; , you can buy a <unk> <unk> for USD <unk> .
We will have to wait for a month and a half .
It has emerged from the long term management of these medium-sized warehouses .
According to the official data of the Ministry , in relation to the period <unk> 2011 , the number of these crimes has been reduced in Russia by 7 % , and it amounts to <unk> miles , while the proven flight and extortion of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances and bombs fell by 2.1 % .
The United States &apos; employees &apos; employees and supermarkets are on strike .
Almost a quarter of young American young people are going through work at home .
Over the last few days , a wave of protests has increased against low wages by the <unk> supermarkets and the famous <unk> chains such as <unk> , <unk> King , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At the moment , no one can predict whether this wave is going to take place as quickly as possible .
These actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing associations .
At the same time , the organisers of the demonstrations want to create the creation of the trade unions at home and in the rapid catering chains , and the organisers of the demonstrations .
At the moment , this sector is not covered by the trade union movement .
Are 46 cents a year .
The demonstrations started last week , after <unk> , the &apos; black Friday &apos; , at a time when a flood of balances has been <unk> by millions of inhabitants in America and at times of <unk> .
On that day , some employees in the <unk> society , who are working in the world 2.2 million people , have left their post to organise strike on strike with the unions and the left-wing activists in the society shops whose products are destined for the consumers of small and medium-sized classes .
Let us put everything on the market .
There is an average of 8 % of products in the world on average to 27 % .
That is why there are a lot of workers who are poorly paid in <unk> .
The price and the choice of products have made up one of the most powerful groups in the United States .
According to criticism , <unk> can afford to sell their cheap products , especially because of the low wages of their employees .
The latter also complain about the difficult working conditions , for example , of the lack of <unk> <unk> or <unk> scanners .
The participants in the demonstrations of the &apos; black Friday &apos; called for a salary increase , they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company has increased by USD 30 to 100 per month .
For the basic employee in <unk> , which affects 9.5 <unk> of the time , it is a sum of money that he cannot afford .
Scientists from the <unk> University of <unk> show that , if we were to increase the average salary at 12 <unk> , it would cost the 3.2 billion dollars .
It is 1.1 % more than it is spending .
If <unk> <unk> all the increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers , then every race in the shop would be EUR 46 cents .
It will be used to spend USD <unk> in a year &apos; s time .
The supporters of <unk> have been able to see with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine states and did not harm the group .
The &apos; black Friday &apos; continued in the shops in the evening at midnight to midnight the next night and <unk> sold on this period .
Its coffers has been carried out at all 100 million transactions for the &apos; black Friday &apos; .
The spokesman for a company Dan <unk> has ensured in an interview on the left <unk> Post Post that , in any case , &apos; less than five &apos; employees of <unk> had left their posts and that the protest was only a &apos; <unk> operation &apos; among so many others on the part of the organised trade union .
<unk>
The protests have continued this week in New York and concerned not the <unk> shops ( in this progressive city , they are not very much appreciated , and so they are not yet established ) but the <unk> and other cheap restaurants .
<unk> to sell billions and after they do not even give you health leave and do not pay for the work you have done honestly !
<unk> <unk> , a member of the National Council in New York
At present , the minimum wage provided for by the federal law and New York is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are increasing with time , but little , on average , on average , in New York <unk> <unk> <unk> .
No one affects them in the city .
For me , it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York .
It was a time of a time when almost a quarter of the young American young people were working at home , and at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , he was working at home .
Few people have seen their main source of income for a long time .
Today , I find myself in the hands of the workers of <unk> who complain that they have to live with this salary and they have to be able to feed their children with their children .
On the other hand , there are some comments on the Wall in the Wall Street Journal saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them .
The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday to <unk> close to the <unk> of the 40th street and on <unk> <unk> demanded that the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> be paid at least 15 <unk> of the hour , or a increase of more than two times that the current minimum wage .
They also asked for trade unions to be created in the rapid catering sector .
US law prohibits the administration of the administration and to punish the demonstrators of a trade union by bullying or redundancies .
However , the administration does not make life easier for them .
For a trade union , it is a difficult task for a trade union , and it is a difficult task , for practical reasons .
One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff .
They do not agree
There have been a number of other <unk> demonstrations with a number of other <unk> chains .
The flagship moment of protest was the meeting in the middle of almost <unk> in Times with the intervention of several local democrats , including <unk> <unk> , a member of the local council , who said : &apos; Let us be honest ! &apos; .
The demonstrators have been supported by other <unk> democrats in order , particularly by the candidate of mayor Bill De <unk> , who said that &apos; we must all support the workers of the rapid restoration so that they obtain a fair wage and economic well-being that every <unk> deserves .
The New York Times has characterised this demonstration as the most important one in the process of the rapid catering sector in its history .
However , only a few hundred people have been involved in the people who have been involved in this , and they are not employees who have been employed in <unk> , who are in New York .
At the moment , it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will take place .
At the moment , it is only possible to mislead the brain .
In recent times , the <unk> of new technologies has become accustomed to the fact that they have become accustomed to the reality of the situation .
Initially , it was Google who revealed this summer &apos;s current model at its annual conference and in November that Microsoft had asked for the patent .
However , it is clear from the maintenance with the director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> Group in Cambridge , <unk> <unk> , that for scientists in this society , glasses are already ancient history .
They are tempted to manipulate virtual objects in the hands of the air , and they are being tempted to manipulate the way in which they are used to manipulate virtual objects .
Could you say a few words about what your research group is doing ?
We are working on the interaction between man and the machine and we are trying at the same time to broaden the borders of this interaction .
As a whole , the whole of humanity has remained in favour of the <unk> on a <unk> screen and at times of <unk> .
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and guess about the radical changes that will happen with this interaction .
For example , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> are a step forward , and almost no <unk> are sold today without <unk> because everyone is interested in order to make a gesture .
What is the point of view of the future .
Although the <unk> has made physical interaction , a lot of things are going on on a single screen , sometimes in <unk> .
The seizure of information has been improved ( the system receives more data ) , but the yield , for the time being , not really .
We are trying to change this , and we are working on the systems of truly <unk> systems operating on different technologies , such as projection technologies .
We need to get the computer world out of ours , in the physical world , to make it more <unk> .
To this end , however , we must identify not only the user but also the space surrounding it .
For example , we can supplement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form .
To begin with , let us start with these stupid <unk> .
What do you think about the voice of voice ?
It is appreciated , but is it not overestimated ?
It cannot be said that it is a panacea : the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of their actions or intentions .
In fact , every type of interaction with the computer is good , but everyone in the niche .
For example , in order the equipment in public places , we had a project for which we thought that gestures , not broad gestures , but rather discreet gestures , restricted .
<unk> were not caught by the machine &apos;s camera , but by a <unk> brought to the hands of the bones of the bones and muscles .
At the moment , it is high , but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a <unk> .
In fact , the future will be marked by a mixed <unk> , for example : the <unk> .
Is it to be said ?
For example , how am I going to pass on this <unk> ?
That is what you would like to say with the words and gestures .
As usual , I am talking only about this .
Oh , it is going to be difficult to recognise .
So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or not do at a time ?
Not necessarily , but it is a matter of mutual rapprochement .
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of <unk> that will enable us to identify the reactions of human beings better .
For example , there is a great deal of a good resolution , and it is very important to do so .
If you are interested in your work on the <unk> <unk> , what do you not like in the modern cameras ?
Do they have a lack of resolution , depth or another ?
In principle , it is the current generation that we are using in our work on <unk> recognition .
It would , of course , be a good thing to get about 8 <unk> with a speed of 1 000 <unk> .
However , the problem is not the <unk> themselves , but the quality of the matrix and the depth .
In relation to this last point , all the current technologies are good enough , and it adds work to <unk> .
We must bear in mind the resolution in accordance with the point of view X .
The speed is very important , as well as the number of frameworks for the second .
Human movements are quite dynamic , and 30 of them are not enough , especially for gestures .
<unk> <unk> , from our laboratory for <unk> , has given a regular delay in the treatment of the <unk> of the treatment of 1 and 100 <unk> .
Everyone does not understand how much this affects the interaction of man and the machine .
I would like to have a system of this kind in my work , but we do not need to affect it in order to have more frameworks for the second .
But should we not increase the number of cameras ?
<unk> today has three cameras , one of which is , in fact , a <unk> issuer and the second , one , a <unk> of the thoughtful signal .
The third camera is in fact a normal <unk> .
It does not serve to define the depth of the subject .
Many cameras could solve this problem .
Or to get worse by increasing the volume required for calculations .
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the <unk> , to play with the cameras and to see how this could help to define the places .
As far as I remember , Microsoft , unlike Google , has not presented their glasses to the public .
Do you not think that , from the point of view of the daily use of the technology technology , glasses are one of the platforms of the world .
Of course , it is not practical , but it is not practical , but I believe that the best option would be an increase in &apos; transitional &apos; which would enable you to move from glasses to the <unk> .
<unk> are a very personal device , and that is what they are doing , and that is what the personal elements are the only one to see and at the same time their weakness : the reality is increased from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in cooperation with other people .
Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual <unk> objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Mr Stark in <unk> <unk> , but also to the death of the death penalty .
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point out : there is no <unk> .
There is nothing to do with it .
What are your group &apos;s response to this challenge ?
In my course , I often say that the reality is increasing is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and the machine .
In my view , the eighth could be the addition of the <unk> of the <unk> .
At the moment , one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand in order to serve as an image .
There is a great deal of pressure in this respect .
However , there are also technologies that are really intended to give the <unk> to these &apos; images in the air &apos; : for example , the interference of several <unk> .
There are also the <unk> placed on the <unk> who affect the <unk> of the fingers , and they are also an axis of work with prospects .
Do you have tried to mislead the brain .
If he is to believe that he feels what he should normally feel about at a time when he sees it ?
This is a good idea , and we have not yet tried to do so .
There is still a <unk> task on which we will have to have a problem for a long time : the way in which someone who is physically in a very small area that he is working in an open space - we are working on the concepts of the race , mobile platforms and also the giants .
At the moment , it is only possible to mislead the brain , but there are still many years of work .
That is what makes the work on virtual reality more attractive to the researcher , which is so interesting for the researcher : there is a lot of things to do .
<unk> and not of culture -
<unk> &apos; is continuing to take place in the middle of the <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; .
This list has already been welcomed by eminent players in the artistic arena in St Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the town of the city and have been recognised in Europe , having been known throughout Russia .
The new hero of &apos; <unk> &apos; is <unk> <unk> Miller .
The whole city is familiar with <unk> Miller , this man rather <unk> , the red and red <unk> of the Russian Museum , the <unk> of summer or <unk> .
<unk> Miller &apos;s tables will always have a number of people , regardless of their place of exposure .
It is one of the fundamental social and philosophical <unk> , one of the founders of the new myths .
<unk> Miller is a distinguished representative of the <unk> of the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s .
It is also a symbol of the city of the city , and it is a symbol of the people and it is a good thing to do .
It has recently been in his hands in his hands of the <unk> , and it has become a symbol of this instrument in St Petersburg , since he had a very difficult role for this difficult role in his existence , its philosophy and its image of <unk> .
<unk> , why is it that you are going to the city at the same time , and not in yellow or blue , for example ?
I have chosen to have the red tape and the image of the red .
In this world , red tape is a compromise between the <unk> , the image of the image and society .
Even though , in society , everything that is not grey is a matter of aggression , there is a great deal of aggression and a negative turmoil .
However , I would like to say that we are in the process of discussion .
The whole of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate .
And when you understand that you had to be <unk> ?
At the exhibition of the Palais of Culture , where my work was concerned .
I understand that this was the way forward .
Therefore , the wave of the old painters has gone through and the new , free , in my own kind .
I started to link my friendship with painters in the new wave , with those of the <unk> who gave rise to &apos; <unk> &apos; and then there has been no vague .
I am interested in the way in which I am interested in the theatre , in the way , in the way of music and music .
It was important to me that all of this was found in your artistic <unk> , which was important for me to be at the heart of the culture of St Petersburg where the best creative forces are to meet .
In 1995 , I took place in <unk> , which took place before the work of a musical and artistic club , a <unk> club , the house of <unk> <unk> .
Many of them were born : the <unk> , <unk> , I see to be able to arrive with the project &apos; Van Gogh &apos; .
<unk> and its friends <unk> easy songs in <unk> in <unk> <unk> , they were among them <unk> <unk> , who are now <unk> .
When the group started to take place in <unk> , it became &apos; <unk> &apos; .
It was not a great deal of emissions before the time of <unk> <unk> .
We gave them <unk> , and then his great career began , but his basic training and basic education is at home that he received .
<unk> &apos; , the Club &apos; Club &apos; : these are the consequences of artistic <unk> .
Our employees have been used as used as used .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture wanted to say something .
In 2000 , a survey was held in the press : it was the price of the figures in our city .
I was appointed &apos; <unk> of the year &apos; , and then my reign has ended .
It is not easy to work in a new era with old rules , I am a representative of the truth , honesty and culture of the century .
Today it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different , we can be popular , but not really a culture of culture .
<unk> work is characterised by a recognisable style .
Many of my tables are <unk> , they have a very strong and very strong situation .
I am going to have a planned exhibition &apos; the Russian museum through the <unk> &apos; .
<unk> belong to a <unk> category .
Before I was a social one , it is a bad thing , and he is afraid to be .
However , with the <unk> , it is a matter of concern to the tragic of the tragic .
I like the grotesque , and I have a grotesque ideas .
For example , the idea of saving the world through the total and compulsory <unk> .
Today , it is what is important , we are interested in the external mechanism , but not within the individual .
Perhaps you cannot give him the hand , but instead we should get it to the <unk> .
It is a lie that lies in the end of the <unk> .
Recently we saw this in the role of the <unk> player - a cultural city must have such heroes .
In other words , I can do so .
Perhaps , perhaps , that commercial art can be good ?
Today , commercial art must be treated , and it is a delicate one .
The disintegration of culture is happening .
Before , the people were divided into herds , the supporters of the <unk> who were in favour of one thing , the <unk> another .
Today , everything is divided into <unk> , and it is difficult to please everyone .
I am not a 100 dollars ticket to please everyone .
Today we have to think about what you are going to do .
There is a great deal of <unk> in every area .
However , there are a number of thousands of people who come to see <unk> <unk> !
They are people who have been set out who have come to see it , it is the sexual and social side that works .
However , for the cultural side , 300 people will come , 10 miles will not come and the end of the day is less management , money , everything .
I have my fans , the main thing that is not to mislead them , not to waste the experience .
When I was a young person , I would like the tables of the tables that a <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
I have started with the tables that are used at the end of the day .
Today , ideas are often confused .
It is said that there is spiritual culture , the culture of consumption .
Consumption does not have a culture ; it has nothing to do with it .
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday , I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who rejected money precisely for paint .
I am in favour of this culture .
<unk> , what is lacking in St Petersburg ?
Good cultural experts .
There is this concept : the official official .
However , all of us cannot work on culture .
Under the rule of good <unk> , that was not the case , the <unk> did not understand the culture , but they understood that the good experts should be kept .
In Moscow , there are good consultants today .
We have people here in St Petersburg , which could be experts , but they are being removed , because we need higher experts who will properly assess these experts and their <unk> .
At the moment , it is the &apos; taste of taste &apos; that is <unk> .
The same <unk> , but they are different in that they say honestly that they do not take the whole of contemporary art , that there are painters who must find themselves in other museums .
For you , what is St Petersburg ?
St Petersburg is not the cultural capital , there is much more culture in Moscow , there is soil for that .
On our side , art is difficult to push .
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers , that is bad .
In Europe , there is a great deal of curious concern to see that there are exhibitions .
In our own country , this layer is very good .
We need to make the art at the beginning of the last century .
The draft has been done with the support of the <unk> .
<unk>
The Earth is at risk .
Climate change or collision with a murderer .
<unk> of space travel with <unk> are to be carried out in search for a aid .
In order to save mankind , a big question arises : how can we continue to make our species live by <unk> or on a aid planet ?
I do not believe that there is a great deal of choice .
In fact , there are two real <unk> that can be won , if only in the case of a hypothesis .
It is a question of <unk> and Mars &apos; , as Vladimir <unk> , a researcher of the <unk> Institute of State <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) .
If we are to have the conditions for life in Mars , the temperature is 500 .
There can only be a great deal of <unk> in space , in space .
We have started to take an interest in reproductive issues in space by focusing on flora .
There are still half a century ago , and we have had experiments on plants .
Four generations of small <unk> <unk> will not be <unk> in any way .
Secondly , insects have been brought into orbit , <unk> <unk> .
In 1979 , <unk> eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo is developing .
It is quite normal to get rid of this .
It is now the case that the problems are beginning .
&quot; The problem is linked to the fact that the <unk> must find support , it must take place on its legs and start to move &apos; , explains the director of the Institute of the <unk> Institute of the <unk> Institute of the European Academy of Sciences ( <unk> ) Vladimir <unk> .
If there is no support , the <unk> will be <unk> .
At the end of 10 o &apos;clock , the new born of the new born was completely <unk> .
<unk> would not be in the light of either in the light or at the same time .
Unfortunately , they would simply die at the end of <unk> days .
&quot; We have <unk> them twice , then we have abandoned , because it is simply impossible to work with them there &apos; , explain Vladimir <unk> to see the failure of the experience with the <unk> in space .
The last &apos; miniature <unk> &apos; with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago .
Experience will continue in the spring of 2013 .
However , the <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; will only be used in the same sex .
There has been an experience with the <unk> sent with their children in space .
In principle , there has been no <unk> .
It was still the case of <unk> and then that is the only experience , and we need to carry out this kind of research &apos; .
After the landing , space rats have created their offspring .
Nevertheless , there is still no way to go into this area in space .
It is no easy matter .
By losing their usual environment , animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instinct .
Contrary to animals , people are able to do so in principle .
<unk> <unk> has abstract thinking , and it is capable of creating a proper emotional basis .
This kind of experience has not been achieved for ethical reasons .
However , women have been in space for 50 years .
The greatest risk has been taken by <unk> .
The female body is what mankind has more valuable .
Our <unk> has increased and no one on Earth could say if he would take a flight in space .
If it could have given birth to a child after flight .
No one was in favour of this question &apos; , which is why it is <unk> <unk> , pensioner and space .
In June 1964 , just one year after its flight in space , the first woman <unk> <unk> <unk> gave rise to a small girl .
The father of the child , <unk> <unk> was also <unk> .
In 1988 , the second woman <unk> <unk> <unk> , after having been twice on orbit and have even worked in the middle of <unk> , led to a son .
However , there is still a risk of the risk .
We have little , even very few <unk> who have had nothing and which give rise to a health , after long flights .
&apos; if they are longer , this is a danger even during flights in orbit &apos; , concludes the pilot and <unk> , hero of the Soviet Union and of Russia , <unk> <unk> .
However , mankind must seek new solutions in biotechnology , radiation protection and the creation of an artificial <unk> .
<unk> from the Centre for the preparation for the <unk> : a compulsory step in the preparation of the <unk> .
In this case , there is nothing to do with the <unk> .
<unk> water is <unk> .
If adults , water is comfortable but , however , a foreign environment , for babies , it is their true element .
Small men would seem to confirm this : life on earth comes from the ocean .
As the baby is changing around 9 months in the <unk> cash of his mother &apos;s <unk> , it is easier to get used to water .
It is logical , in principle , because since its birth up to its first <unk> , only 2 weeks ago .
It is very little to forget &apos; , the <unk> of the <unk> for infants , Marina <unk> .
In a word , if for the child who has just born the <unk> , it is a more natural state , the woman needs <unk> , a strong force .
In <unk> , the muscles of the <unk> , the river basin are <unk> very quickly , the <unk> of the baby .
It is a good thing that we do not know about this , and we do not know that it will be possible to do so on the basis of childbirth .
Of course , we can prepare for birth in a special chamber , and the woman will be able to get out of it .
Secondly , it is a question of asking <unk> <unk> to think about this complex issue .
On the other hand , the child needs an artificial <unk> .
If it does not feel the land attraction , the body does not form a <unk> or the <unk> system .
It is not possible to pay an adult as an adult with a special combination for <unk> .
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs .
&quot; And this experience that we are <unk> in this case by creating the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to a disabled child , which is fully <unk> &apos; , provides for the <unk> of the Institute for the Institute of <unk> <unk> .
The birth of children in space is still in theory .
However , with the time that will become a reality , when the <unk> will travel to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their children born in space .
The head of the <unk> ( the superior institution of public finances ) has said : &apos; control of the <unk> self-employment ( Czech ) ) has failed because of politicians .
In the field of public procurement , the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation , but it is lagging behind with regard to its application .
That is what <unk> <unk> said , the Vice-President of the senior institution of public finance in an interview for <unk>
The law will never be perfect , but its application must be fair and , in my opinion , it is what is lacking in us &apos; , and it said that he said in his comment on the current situation .
<unk> by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions .
As an example of the abuse of the &apos; <unk> system &apos; approach by <unk> <unk> .
Mr Prime Minister has recently said that the <unk> was not going to have been to find a lot of work for entrepreneurs with controls , so it would be possible or banned ?
The law must be applied in one way or another , if it prohibits something , even the Head of Government cannot prevent an authority to be able to inspect the law to demand compliance with the law &apos; .
At the meeting of the Committee on Control in the House of Deputies , you mentioned a <unk> project in which the legislation on the procurement of these two countries was compared .
What was the case in the case of what was actually about ?
This is a parallel control that we have launched about two years ago .
In simple terms , European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and special national legislation , as well as practice .
We have gathered all this and , although this control procedure has not yet been completed , there have been very interesting differences in our legislation : generally speaking , our legislation is perhaps &apos; more stringent and better &apos; , however , according to certain parameters , the practice as such is better in Germany .
This is why it is not enough to develop more and more detailed rules , but it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law .
What can be done with this project in concrete terms , and that is what can be done about it ?
A common monitoring of this type should help us to stop trying to specify the laws , to lower and improve the thresholds , when it does not really have a positive effect .
The principle of good management means obtaining this in question at a reasonable price - which does not always mean the lowest - in order to exclude enrichment and possible criminal activity .
By reducing the market thresholds , however , we will not necessarily achieve this objective .
It may be that this system is so flooded with red tape , and that those who are seeking loopholes will be much higher than if the threshold had remained higher .
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation .
How does the German control system work ?
Is there any such thing as a different institution or a different way of organisation ?
As far as the institutions are concerned , there is a lot of work in the field of the <unk> , which is being organised by the <unk> , which is a little different , but these two institutions are fundamentally similar .
To some extent , the competences are also similar to our own system : Germany is a federal structure , so it also has such a federal structure , so it also has such a situation in the Länder .
<unk> can only monitor the federal money , which is in line with the state &apos;s resources .
Public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are being controlled at the level of the German Länder &apos;s accounts .
With regard to national legislation , is it simpler than ours ?
I would not like to make a general comparison of any concrete data , but in some areas , Germany is often designated as a model , but it is certainly not possible to say that it does better in all areas .
Is it the case that this is because they have better inspectors .
No , certainly not , but I repeat , I do not have a comparison .
However , it must also be said that the country which we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems .
Otherwise , it would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution .
With regard to national legislation , what has been said for you as an institution , the amendment of the public procurement law , its effects are already felt ?
This amendment has entered into force relatively recently , but does not have an impact on our control operations .
As we are carrying out a posteriori check , there must be some delay in it .
Our comments relate only to the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for &apos; detection of risk of mismanagement &apos; with which we have examined almost 14 000 public tenders and so on .
Do you consider to see the adoption of this law as an advantage , rather than an advantage or more burden for administration ?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction , and I hope that the future will confirm that the future will be confirmed .
The problem that may arise is that these rules are becoming more stringent and that they cannot be respected .
Even under the previous regulation , the provider ( for example , the Regional Council , for example , in the case of regional operational programmes ) will <unk> the issues controlled to accept that any violation of the law on markets means a breach of budgetary discipline .
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way ?
No , I do not think of this way in this way .
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it , but not punish those who commit formal errors without any consequence of the decision-making process .
Such a system will benefit from pressure on administration .
So what is the way to get out ?
Let us look at where we are not going .
Recently , the Prime Minister said that the <unk> was not going to penalise entrepreneurs with controls on the so-called <unk> system - what does this mean ?
Is the <unk> system <unk> or authorised ?
The law must be applied in one way or another , when it prohibits something , even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority to be able to inspect and demand compliance with the law .
It may say : &apos; We will change the law and allow it &apos; , but it cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing was done .
The law on markets contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be done , precisely in order to protect the call for tender .
It is tragic , however , that it is a tragedy that has been eliminated only because of formal defects .
The law will never be perfect , but its application must be fair and , in my opinion , is lacking .
The roads are in frozen places , but most of them are workable .
In some places in the Czech Republic , the roads are frozen and also <unk> .
However , the network is largely practicable , in some places with greater vigilance .
The region of <unk>
In the region of <unk> <unk> , the roads were in the middle of this morning , but in frozen places , and in the same way as well .
The temperatures have fallen and <unk> ° ° C , but they should go back to the day .
<unk> has stopped in the region , and there is only a <unk> of snow .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , however , are <unk> of around 30 centimetres .
According to the information of the regional road maintenance service , it is clear that there is a lack of visibility in the light of the fog .
The rapid path of the region and the national roads of the region are now feasible .
However , there is still a great deal of vigilance , for example , with regard to some of the bridges that can be frozen .
All road roads and the third category routes , including mountain roads , are also feasible .
There are still some of their sections of frozen snow , and there are still a number of areas in which traffic is <unk> .
Above all , there is a need for greater vigilance in those areas in the area of industry .
<unk> and <unk> regions
The Directorate-General for the road and motorways points out on its website that some eastern <unk> roads are threatened by the training of <unk> , and that traffic in mountain areas will be used on the roads in mountainous areas and at the <unk> .
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risks of training in the area of the <unk> region .
There can be some <unk> in the vicinity of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> <unk> , mainly on <unk> and third category roads .
<unk> I / 43 and I / 34 around around <unk> have been dealt with .
<unk> is mainly in the <unk> of <unk> ( <unk> ) and the <unk> of <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
In the districts of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , a layer of snow <unk> by traffic is on the roads on the roads .
In East Bohemia , the time will be dry , the most often , with possible <unk> passages .
It will take up a weak wind and the temperature of <unk> ° ° 1 and + <unk>
region
The roads in the <unk> region are now feasible , although , in places , there is a need for greater vigilance and to adapt its conduct to weather conditions .
This morning , in fact , is a freeze between <unk> and <unk> ° C. .
After the last snow of snow and the cooling which followed , there are a number of communication routes that can be in place .
Drivers can expect to be able to pass through fog , and there will be a gradual increase in visibility .
It is clear from the information of the regional road maintenance service .
The <unk> motorway is practicable , without any difficulties , but it is a matter of course that the road communications services are recommending greater vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131 .
In most of the world &apos;s roads , it is dry and frozen .
Some sections can be frozen in the <unk> district in the <unk> district .
<unk> and the third category are <unk> and in this case warning against frozen sections .
Drivers must be vigilant , particularly on the <unk> roads in the <unk> region .
region
It is now the case that drivers are travelling to the areas in the area of <unk> in the area of <unk> .
This layer has remained on the <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; and on the road to <unk> <unk> , following the chemical treatment operations .
<unk> has forced this night to travel on the roads to go on the ground ; according to road services , there has been more than three centimetres in the <unk> district .
In the other parts of the region , most of the roads are feasible without difficulties .
On the <unk> district of the <unk> district , there are <unk> .
<unk> drivers in <unk> must expect to meet in the so-called &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; , which has been said today in <unk> the leader of the <unk> district transport services .
Their colleagues in the <unk> district have also been on the ground during the night ; according to them , after the chemical treatment of the roads , the roads are now being released and <unk> , even in the highest areas .
In the <unk> district of <unk> the roads are feasible without difficulties , in the <unk> district of the drivers , however , should be careful in the areas of forest areas in the <unk> areas .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
From this point of view , there have been a number of difficult sections of the services in the north of the North <unk> .
According to the police data , it is clear that , in addition to certain places covered by snow or <unk> , the mountain and mountain route from <unk> to <unk> na <unk> is closed .
The temperatures will remain below zero , and therefore snow and <unk> should remain on the roads , and in the plains , particularly in the south is central in Bohemia , there is no problem and roads are generally dry .
There has been no difficulty in the issue of traffic at the moment .
Road maintenance services have pointed out the presence of <unk> , particularly around <unk> .
According to the <unk> , the night of the night was ideal for his training : rain and snow in the day , <unk> and frozen at night .
Since the main areas of circulation , we have also been pointing out difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The closure of the movement between <unk> and <unk> is due to the <unk> of trees that have been <unk> up to the road .
<unk> <unk> said : &apos; Together , we want to collect positive energy &apos; .
What do you think about the fact that , in less than a month , this should be the end of the world ?
It is only one of these alarming news , the kind of traps we like to end up with .
In our Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( <unk> ) , it is a matter of course , and it is said that we are the only group that is able to collect a lot of positive energy in order to postpone or prevent the end of the world .
Moreover , in December , you will have a completely unique project : three <unk> against the end of the world .
Can you give more detail to this project to our readers ?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for for two years .
We have decided to use the marketing potential by the end of the <unk> timetable announced for 21 December at 11 a.m.
On the eve of the day , on 20 December , there will be three <unk> at the same time , in Prague , <unk> and <unk> .
They will end up almost at a time when the timetable will end on the island of <unk> , which is in the peaceful Ocean , in advance of 12 hours compared to us .
Who has had this idea ?
At the outset , I think that was my idea , and then we did everything with our creators , <unk> <unk> .
Apart from the fact that we want to collect sufficient positive energy to save the world , we also want to think together , together with the public , to think about the state of the world that we leave to our children .
At the end of the <unk> calendar , we have created a collection of unique objects , including footwear , <unk> , bags , and original keys to the end of the world , to buy them online on <unk> on <unk> people can also support us .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( <unk> ) , with other interpreters , have also had an anthem against the end of the world which is entitled &apos; at the end of the <unk> <unk> &apos; ( Czech Czech Czech ) <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Is it very popular , and it is also very popular , at the same time as it is at these <unk> <unk> ?
Of course , at the end of the day , if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be at the same time , at the same time , by all the interpreters in the three <unk> .
The anthems will also join in a given moment in the context of a direct programme of Czech television .
The words of this song have been written by <unk> <unk> , who is also the main role of Jesus in the <unk> , <unk> X .
How are you to cooperate with them ?
We are working together with other people in the Czech <unk> , because of the fact that we are organising many <unk> and events ...
We are trying to involve them intensively with these projects .
It has become clear that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that they are <unk> .
What will the benefits of these things be against the end of the world ?
<unk> training the <unk> training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on within the framework of the <unk> Institute , with the <unk> association , and this for six years .
There are a regular number of teachers from the <unk> Institute and they are offering them to do so .
Students themselves do not have the means to go to course , we are trying to help them in this way .
As part of the completion of the construction of the <unk> Institute , we will be <unk> this project into a new independent building .
There are a number of music groups and interpreters on the scene in each of these <unk> ?
What criteria do you have chosen ?
We have tried to draw up a programme for all generations , including children .
For example , in Prague , <unk> on the <unk> stage , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
There will be any details of the details of the matter .
Will you also be able to do so in the future of &apos; <unk> events &apos; .
In May , we will take place for the first time in the spring of Prague ; here too , we will certainly prepare a good programme with interesting guests .
We would also like to take the next year in the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally , once again in the United States , I would like to combine together in Washington and Chicago .
Your international projects are minimalist , for example , in Madrid , Brussels , London and Moscow .
The <unk> <unk> , however , is a group of disabled people .
How can you see the organisation and logistics of your <unk> ?
It is not so terrible that it is the first one .
We have five Members who have been used to travel in the <unk> , of course , and we will also have a great deal of luggage and <unk> .
Up to now , everything has been more or less always done , <unk> and British Airways was always fully prepared for us , and they were surprised by me once again .
Even in Moscow , where we came back recently , everything has happened without problems .
Thanks to your travel abroad , you can compare what these countries differ in terms of access to people with reduced mobility , the attitude of public opinion in relation to disabled people and so on .
What are your experiences so far ?
After Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places where everything works better than at home , we have been witnesses to Moscow only at an initial stage .
In relation to Prague , Moscow is still very little accessible to disabled people ; there is still no knowledge that one person is moving alone as an electric service in the centre of the city .
They do not yet see as a matter of course to give priority to a person in a lift .
Fortunately , there is an association which is trying to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created .
What do we have to do with the more developed countries ?
There is a lot of things for which we are still lagging behind ...
It is important to mention that improvements and <unk> are still dependent on the efforts made by the people concerned .
In London and Madrid , it is quite clear that people with a heavy handicap move on alone in public spaces ; they can go to the <unk> , the museum , anywhere else ...
It is not very often there that a large number of disabled people are actively involved in social life , on this point you , the <unk> <unk> , are rather at the forefront of progress !
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing , but the situation will really begin to change when we have sportsmen , artists , players , politicians or <unk> lawyers .
At the moment , these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will .
The <unk> <unk> is currently very popular , back back in a few years &apos; time , what has led you in 1998 to create this group ?
I started working as a <unk> to the <unk> Institute , where I was surrounded by many young people who are prepared to invest in something .
As I am a <unk> ( I am playing , among others , <unk> ) , with a colleague , we have created music .
Then , with time , as our <unk> <unk> says , we have lost control of the situation .
The success has only happened in recent years , if I am not mistaken ?
It is true that creating links with well-known <unk> and working actively to promote the group has helped us .
We have understood that , if work is not visible , it is as if it did not exist .
Thanks to European Union subsidies , we can , in addition , allow good teachers , equipment , and so on .
Is it intended to achieve such a level with <unk> <unk> ?
From the outset , I felt that there was a potential to change things .
There is a great deal of business to do with each other .
In some ways , it is logical : everything that is new is accepted with caution , and that is long overdue .
There are few original plans , and I dare to say that I would say that <unk> <unk> is one of them .
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is , of course , mercy , and it is natural ...
It is completely unnecessary , however , because people with a disability are not <unk> , abandoned from all of us , that we need to take care of .
These are people who can live in a full life and flourish , provided that we have the necessary resources .
I often say that when people with a disability come to achieve something , it is not just a step forward for them but for the whole of society .
Is your success not due to the fact that you are a demanding leader , as you are described by many people ?
If we are to make good work , we must be intransigent in many areas and demand discipline .
However , I think that this is quite normal .
Some people arrive at home with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and , when they realise that they need to come to repeat twice a week , follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for <unk> , they lose quickly their enthusiasm .
However , it is working in the same way in every group that wants to work and to achieve objectives .
The <unk> Group is currently taking over 20 members .
How many of them were in 1998 ?
One , <unk> <unk> .
It is an open group , and there is nothing to do with them .
Our doors are still open to those who want or would want to join us .
This will be the case on the eve of the planned day of the end of the world , on Thursday 20 December 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the <unk> arena , in <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic .
At the end of the evening , these three cities will be connected by the audiovisual relays , which will be linked to the <unk> of the <unk> Group , at the end of the <unk> <unk> .
The aim of the concert is to bring together financial resources ( up to 25 million <unk> ) to equip the <unk> training centre in Prague in the <unk> Institute .
The price of a ticket in this concert is 400 <unk> , and the entry is free of charge for children up to 12 years , the <unk> of tickets is open to <unk> .
Poland and <unk> .
Last week , at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency , Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of this agency , it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc ( the Czech Republic has become full member of 12 November 2008 ) .
Poland had started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and in the course of the years followed by a number of projects from the agency .
Poland &apos;s road to space has , however , started much earlier .
Even before the Second World War , <unk> Poles were working on space flights , and they did not always have any understanding .
I would like to mention , for example , the conference of <unk> <unk> to the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933 , during which it <unk> ideas from his <unk> book entitled &apos; <unk> to <unk> &apos; .
The development of this young engineer ( born in 1905 ) <unk> the cold auditors and the years later , <unk> , only Dr Jan <unk> <unk> his work .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> in France , the Robert <unk> and André Louis Hirsch for his work &apos; <unk> to space &apos; .
The case of Dr Jan <unk> ( <unk> - 1966 ) was a great <unk> of the <unk> and space of space .
There are hundreds of articles in Polish and <unk> newspapers in the Polish newspapers that are devoted to this scientific discipline .
<unk> has become a <unk> of the <unk> space of the world , its contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name has been given to one of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> was built in Poland as a <unk> to be equipped with a <unk> engine .
Unfortunately , neither the author nor the details of the project are aware of this .
Nor is it clear whether the <unk> should be used to <unk> or curb the <unk> .
The only information that is known about this <unk> is that of the press in the time .
From 1933 , the Polish artillery <unk> to devote itself to rockets .
Research was carried out by the <unk> <unk> Institute in cooperation with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It is clear from the documents that have been maintained that this research has reached the test stage .
Of course , with the arrival of the German armies , research has stopped .
In <unk> , the plans for a <unk> hunting <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> engineer , <unk> in the specialist press and the following year was published &apos; <unk> - <unk> <unk> i <unk> &apos; of an author called <unk> .
The aim of these two projects was military use of missiles .
Just before the war , all the projects of the use of rockets were carried out by the Interim Advisory Committee ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , which would all work .
This committee was set up in <unk> , but after two years of operation , the start of the war at the end of its activities .
After the war , other work on aviation was published in the Polish press , thanks to the Polish aerospace company ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) .
For the first time , we are talking about a society in November 1954 in the <unk> newspaper , in which four more detailed articles for aviation are found .
In one of these articles , written by Professor <unk> , he is proposed to create a society devoted to the use of a <unk>
At that time , artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had the future .
At the beginning of 1956 , the Polish aerospace company ( <unk> ) <unk> efforts to enter the International <unk> Federation ( created in 1951 ) and in the autumn , the <unk> was a regular member .
The next year , the first President of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> - 1959 ) , became Vice-President of the International <unk> Federation .
It would be up to his death in 1959 .
From 1956 , the <unk> <unk> a significant contribution to the successful development of the <unk> weather <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , which became the first Polish <unk> to carry out scientific research .
The first model , <unk> , was completed in 1957 and the first launch was on 10 October 1958 .
This <unk> of <unk> metres had a length of 80 cm and a little less than 5 kg .
Subsequently , an improved version was built and , during the summer of 1959 , the flight tests from <unk> to two <unk> were started in the desert desert .
This was a long way of 1.4 metres and probably <unk> kg .
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - <unk> <unk> should have been able to have an scope up to <unk> km and to be used to observe the wind at <unk> .
In 1963 , however , all the development work was halted .
In the course of the period 1962 , in the run-up to 1962 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> , which was designed with two <unk> , had a complete length of <unk> and an initial weight of <unk> kg .
Three models ( called <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) were developed , and they were developed by the dimensions of the size of the area reserved for scientific tools .
<unk> <unk> had an area with a volume of 0.4 litre , while in <unk> this volume was <unk> litre and <unk> litre litre .
The maximum scope of all these types of gear was 37 km .
In the period 1965 - 1968 , the rockets were set up in the aviation institute , the first <unk> flight tests in October 1970 .
<unk> <unk> had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful burden of 10 kg at an altitude of around 60 km .
Subsequently , the <unk> and <unk> versions were built .
There is still a need to mention the entry of Poland to the <unk> ( Committee for Research Research ) in 1960 and the creation of a <unk> National Committee later .
In the context of the <unk> programme , Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and , in 1978 , the pilot pilot <unk> became the second <unk> of this programme .
The repeal of the public utility law is not a solution .
Last week , the Constitutional Court has abolished the law on public utility .
This decision has been raised in public opinion in public opinion .
There is no doubt that it is interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view .
The economic systems that are based on liberalism , both in the EU and in the context of globalisation , are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition .
This means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are still in conflict with each other .
This is a result of the principle of free trade and free movement ( without limits ) of the private capital of the private capital , which is linked to unbridled financial speculation .
The considerable differences in the price of labour ( salaries ) generate tension on prices .
We must put the following meaning to this end : a producer is trying to import goods that are sold at low levels of economic competition by &apos; making the price of competitor more expensive , with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and increasing its own profits .
On a large scale , this means most entrepreneurs : to transfer production abroad , to buy at low prices , or disappear , and the result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies .
Given that private capital has no responsibility from a social point of view and by the same token of responsibility for unemployment that it creates , the social burden of the state will inevitably increase .
The whole situation is intensifying the very good will of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit .
This is something that is known as public knowledge that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data .
The unscrupulous practices of private capital are causing a situation in which the governments of the various countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital .
In other words , governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse .
This is mainly reflected in the legislation in force .
The aim is to force its own people economically to accept the diktat of private capital prices , particularly in the area of wages .
This is happening on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and the restriction of workers &apos; rights in the field of labour legislation .
The result of this is growing poverty and the deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor .
In the Federal Republic of Germany , there have been a number of public distribution points for the poor of the world for the people who are unable to meet with their own work .
There are already many millions of people who have been able to do so .
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy , it is quite clear that employees receive such wages that the state is forced to pay an additional amount of money so that they reach the minimum minimum .
For example , this is a scandal that has been updated in the case of employees who are working as a <unk> in the Federal Parliament .
The economic measures of almost all the southern Member States of the EU are undoubtedly creating a similar situation in which , under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of society , people are forced to emigrate ( as the case in the 19th century ) , in the hope that private capital is investing in their country .
We have to ask ourselves : where will this capital come from ?
If it comes from other EU countries , then poverty will come from one country to another ; that capital can not come from either , or then a Chinese , an Indian , a <unk> , a Turk , a <unk> , a <unk> or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary .
This applies to the whole of Latin America .
The liberal theory and the media say that the state of affairs in the world cannot make capital investment in its own economy .
Private capital is very much in favour of the fact that the state cannot intervene in the economy by means of regulatory intervention .
The question of whether private capital does not influence and , in fact , does not take the lead at present , according to its own selfish interests , the whole of the country .
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes .
It is clear that there is an almost strong lobby in all the Member States .
The result of this is a desperate situation in the field of corruption , with mutual benefits , with mutual benefits , in legislation , where everything is reprehensible , but not punishable .
In the Federal Republic of Germany , the situation is such as that , because of the lack of financial resources , there is a lack of money on the part of the national ministries , and that is why the national ministries have to delegate the draft legislation .
It is now adopted in the Bundestag .
The whole of the power does not come from the people , as they say in the case of the constitutions of the Western Union , but powerful financial groups for their own interests .
It is clear that democracies geared towards liberalism are now rapidly faced with the situation described by <unk> in its book entitled &apos; the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar &apos;s Caesar and <unk> &apos; : &apos; The state has long been in a failure and the functions were assigned to violence .
<unk> , who have been illegally obtained , and the stones and the <unk> were used in order to obtain these posts .
The <unk> and corruption without limits and the people went to the elections with votes that were already sold &apos; ... &apos; people were not in a position to get democracy in mind , but it is Caesar who has become an irreversible one , and it is true that <unk> had in mind , but it is Caesar who has turned democracy into an irreversible regime , and it is true that <unk> had in mind , but it is Caesar who has turned democracy into an irreversible regime , and it is true that <unk> had in
In conclusion , the current society is based on the fact that it is based on the basis of the preference of personal profit , not least in the interests of society as a whole .
In its essence , private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole .
As a result of this , as a result of the past , it is the case of the fact that it is not possible for the elites , but not to make any effort to carry out far-reaching reforms .
We therefore need to look for the causes of the emergence of the fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalisation of the 19th and 20th centuries .
As things stand , we can see the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of the liberal democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage .
The fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses of life , humanitarian and social crises , as well as the crimes against humanity , as we know them through ancient and recent history .
The repeal of the law on public utility is not a solution , at least in the long term .
Under pressure from economic competition , both at international and internal level , the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of reducing the social level of the population .
This is a systemic trend .
The solution is , in fact , for social social reforms , which will strengthen the investment of the state in the economy , which will increase the influence of the citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state .
There is a chaos of the chaos of Israel .
It will never emerge from the violence , and it will never be possible to say that it will be possible to say &apos; <unk> &apos; in the song &apos; <unk> &apos; .
If my son did not want wars , it would not be possible to say that it would be &apos; , and that is the case of the woman &apos;s wife , who said that it would not be possible to say that he was in a position of war .
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip , as usual , there have been a great many reactions .
Some people are taking the place of Israel , who is entitled to self-defence and put the Palestinians into the role of terrorists , who are supporting the Palestinians , invoking the genocide of the State of Israel , the genocide against the Arabs of Palestine and from Israel as a terrorist state .
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim , who is the victim of the <unk> of the people who are the victim of this situation , which is , in fact , a victim of the people who are the victims of the European Union , who are , in fact , a victim of the whole of the people who have been subjected to this political situation , and they have been born in the present political situation and have not lived at the beginning of the
I would like to offer the readers one point of view behind the end of the curtain .
Some of these considerations are based on historical facts that are available to the study , and there are some of them in my own understanding of what is happening in this area , and that is what is the most important group of individuals , which is the main body of events in modern history .
The history of mankind is above all the history of the fight for power .
At every time , we can find a <unk> of the Grand or <unk> .
What is not so obvious is whether or not they were able to act independently , or if they were to act independently , they were to be able to act independently .
We must admit that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration will lead to a number of powers .
Among the families with an astronomical wealth of wealth is particularly different from the <unk> family , which could be seen as the head of the <unk> ( I do not know whether these families still have a leader , but I do not exclude it ) .
It is not a question of which it is written .
Of course , there is no doubt about this .
From the 1990s of the 19th century , they have acquired the first World press Agency ( <unk> ) to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts , which they had always meant for them to increase their power , an increase in their wealth or the two .
They have major contributions in almost most of the central banks in the world , and they are preparing or lead wars against the countries in which they do not yet have such contributions ( before the invasion of Afghanistan only 4 , after the invasion of the Russian Central Bank ) .
Anyone who has tried to fight against this family is dead .
It is a question of the Bank of America who refused to renew the European Central Bank of America to the Bank of America .
<unk> <unk> to make clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF , and it was murdered in 1963 , and he was murdered in 1963 , and he was murdered in 1963 , and he was murdered in 1963 , when he wanted to take a trial against the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929 .
Their thirst for power at global level has led to the development of the <unk> in the years <unk> in <unk> in the form of a plan of three world wars by Albert <unk> , which has been initiated by a <unk> .
The first war was intended to eliminate the major state <unk> of Europe , the second was to remove colonialism , particularly British , and the third should reduce the world &apos;s population between 1 and 0.5 billion people ( the <unk> is nothing other than the beginning of such a solution ) and ultimately acquire absolute power .
The method used by the most rich family clan in their heads is to create a crisis , and it is a question of creating a crisis , and then there is a need for a crisis to be put into place in chaos , and then , in the following way , there is a question of chaos .
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation ( see the creation of the EDF in order to prevent crises such as those they <unk> in <unk> ) .
Having managed to trigger the first world war by the murder in Sarajevo in Sarajevo , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> Habsburg , which has led to the <unk> of the <unk> , by causing a <unk> revolution .
The first world war is suddenly being created by a German capitulation without economic and military justification ( the war was no longer needed for the destruction of <unk> Russia ) and was followed by the fragmentation of <unk> , the power of Central Europe .
For a more easy outbreak of the Second World War , bankers have left the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict : they have , on the one hand , imposed a great deal of repairs to Germany , including a strong German minority , which had to play the role of the fifth pillar , and , on the other hand , they will have a great deal of the fifth pillar to put fire to the <unk> and to trigger a war .
At the end of the 19th century , the creation of the <unk> movement , including one of the branches of a Jewish state in the creation of a Jewish state , , preferably in the area of the historic <unk> , in Jerusalem as capital ( back to <unk> ) .
The <unk> Declaration , which has been mentioned above all , is the basis of the mass emigration of the Jews to Palestine and the main friction with the Arab local population .
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides .
The Second World War , and it is difficult to appreciate that Hitler has broken off the channels in which the international bankers had initially had to do so ; or if everything he has done was planned , the fact is that the suffering of the Jews in Europe in the concentration camps is the basis of acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community .
It was officially based in 1948 on the basis of the fact that it was based on the basis of the Second World War , and it was the case that it was the case of the Second World War , and it was a fire of the country of Israel , which was a fire for a third world war .
If the international bankers are to be able to trigger this war , the Jewish people will be like it , as it was in the Second World War , the first victim of the fighting , and this time as well as the people of the Arab people or in the Middle East .
It is a huge laboratory that is , in fact , a great laboratory , and the source of discord and chaos , not only in the country , but at international level , but at international level , it is enough to see how people are strongly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel ) .
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , where there is another harm in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , where there is another harm in the conflict on the part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , where there is another damage to the whole of the conflict , and the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world ?
We must make a difference between the ordinary people of Israel and their leaders , because there is no doubt about the fact that it is up to the people of Israel and their leaders , because there is no doubt about that , because it is up to us to make a distinction between the people of Israel and their own .
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a <unk> politician , who is fair to international bankers , who is doing everything in order to trigger a war with Iran , which could , because of the country &apos;s accession to the Shanghai organisation , to become a global conflict and , as Iran is monitoring the Strait of <unk> by which 20 % of the world &apos;s oil is to be destroyed , to become a global conflict and , given that Iran is monitoring the Straits of <unk> by which 20 % of
In the light of what David <unk> said in 1994 , the only thing that we need is to do so : &apos; The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order &apos; .
In their view , the new world order is a world of masters and slaves .
A world in which a handful of finance <unk> is served by the rest of the human population .
A world in which any new born has been established at the birth of an electronic chip , which is being established by a single <unk> , is being established .
What they are doing is to make it possible for all individuals , small and small , rich and poor , to be able to wear their hands on the front of their hands , so that they can not buy or sell the red Curtain , so that it can not buy or sell those who do not have the name of this harsh <unk> or the figure .
It is clear that anyone who makes sense of common sense is a good one .
There are a number of people who are in favour of a number of people .
The film film is going to be done in the wrong way , as it is to be done .
In November 1979 , there were a host of demonstrators with Islamist students who have been attacked by the US Embassy in Tehran and <unk> .
They had to be released in exchange in exchange for the Shah , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who had been in favour of his regime in the United States , who have been in favour of his regime for decades .
The situation did not provide the US administration with a positive outcome , and it could not , indeed , abandon the Shah , because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries .
However , in Iran , where the revolution has led to the establishment of a theocratic regime , it was able to achieve the release of the hostages .
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States , which has been made even worse by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force .
In the end , the diplomats were released at the end of the day after the negotiations held by the Algerian Government .
Their fate in the United States has a wave of solidarity and a sense of solidarity .
This is a defeat which is very much in the face of the defeat of Mr Carter , in the face of the fact that Mr Carter has been defeated by the end of the presidential elections .
The <unk> film , the player and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , as a result of this , is described as a result of a small victory in America .
Just before it is occupied by the embassy of the Embassy of the embassy .
After complicated times , they are going to be <unk> in the case of the Canadian Ambassador .
In conjunction with the Canadian authorities , the CIA will be able to get them out of Iran through an <unk> coverage : they will <unk> the country with Canadian passports as members of a <unk> team to make <unk> for a film .
<unk>
The expert &apos;s plan of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In order to make the myth more credible , there was a great deal of expertise in the field of the film , and that was the case in which there was a great deal of contact between the European Union and the European Union , and there was a great deal of offices , and there was a real job of business .
The details of the <unk> operation for a long time , as a result of the film , are based on the memory of the film .
The film film film is an unusual combination of a number of sexes .
On the one hand , it is a political <unk> designed in a realistic way , but also a &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; , the story of a successful blow , a <unk> - as , for example , in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> : sequences of Tehran , in the <unk> sequences , are presented with <unk> photographs of the time and the way in which , thanks to these photographs , these same situations were <unk> in the film , there are no big differences .
In the light of more light of Hollywood , which is being treated with irony and a little exaggeration .
It is a matter of the <unk> of the CIA &apos;s headquarters and other institutions with men who are talking about the situation around conference tables , in the corridors and on the telephone .
Ben <unk> has been able to restart his career in a remarkable way .
It has become a <unk> player , and it has become a respected player , and it has been a <unk> game , and it has ceased to be a player .
<unk> is its third <unk> after the dark policeman &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos; ( 2007 ) and the <unk> <unk> ( 2010 ) .
This is also the first film film , which is not taking place in the city of the city of origin .
There is one of the characteristics of the atmosphere of the atmosphere of the atmosphere , which is one of the most important features of the European Union .
It is also the case of the atmosphere in which it is a good idea of the atmosphere of the atmosphere where the role of Tehran is being held by Canada .
The best scenes of the film are taking place on the streets , in the reconstruction of real facts ; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability in a given place .
<unk> and his staff have a similar effect in the dark scenes ( the false <unk> team in Tehran &apos;s <unk> ) .
Too many areas of action .
In fact , in fact , there has been a great deal of action on the part of the European Union , and it is not enough for us to do so far in the film sector .
It is a very good thing , sometimes , it is adding certain elements to the reality and there , the result is not always so elegant ( the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is excluded by hair ) .
The weakness of <unk> lies in its <unk> , due to the need to show too many events in different places .
It is true that Alan <unk> and John <unk> are completely <unk> in their role as <unk> <unk> , and they would have deserved a greater place , and that is not the only way to do so .
The film film is a little of dramatic tension , and it will be seen with a moderate interest , with a moderate interest in the fact and style of the 1970s .
It leads to a spectator , but with difficulty .
As a reminder of the fact that it is a history that is still incomplete to date , as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the secret service as <unk> and <unk> , it is the case .
Rules of Procedure , bananas and <unk>
The <unk> server , which takes a public investigation into the most absurd bank charges every year , has decided on the most absurd of bank charges , which has now been decided on to start the regulation or ideas from the &apos; EU workshop &apos; .
The fact that the EU is planning , these recent times , to adopt a quota of 40 % of women for the direction of the big European companies has been the cause of our decision &apos; , which has been said by the newspaper , <unk> <unk> .
Among the nonsense mentioned , for example , the European Court &apos;s recent decision to unify insurance for men and women , for example .
Up to now , women have been in an active position with regard to insurance tariffs because , objectively , they represent a lesser risk for insurance companies .
People can tell us until the end of the year , which is so incredible as to say &apos; the <unk> workshop &apos; .
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013 , which has been informed of <unk> .
Among the controversial regulations in the EU is , for example , the obligation to add organic components to fuels , which has harmful consequences for the environment , or the ban on the use of the <unk> of hens , which has led to the increase in the price of eggs .
There has also been criticism of the fact that the use of the term &apos; butter butter &apos; or the withdrawal of the sale of traditional bulbs has been said in the past .
Quality bananas must be set up to 14 centimetres .
The European administration often is reacting under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states ( thus the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto ) .
For example , the interests of the lobby groups , for example , are the cause of the fact that bananas should not be less than 14 cm or to present a &apos; abnormal <unk> &apos; .
The European Commission has been in favour of the fact that it has been in a position to harmonise national standards in its own way , and it is only possible to harmonise trade .
The rules on fruit and vegetables have been relaxed in spite of the opposition of some states , claiming that the existing directives lead to a waste of food .
The first price will be awarded in this investigation into the EU regulation last year , according to which there should be a warning that there should be a warning that children under the age of the age of 8 should not be allowed to grow up with the monitoring of adults .
The EU has made reference to an American investigation that is the first cause of death of children by <unk> .
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age in order to blow to <unk> .
In our own country , there are some bizarre ideas in this area .
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd : because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece , anyone who has an official role within the EU cannot use the name &apos; Macedonia &apos; and must instead speak of FYROM ( <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ) .
Together with the association of liberal economists , the <unk> server has been appointed in this investigation , in addition to some of the nonsense mentioned above , the EU regulation on the volume of food products in the Czech Republic .
The EU has set maximum volumes for the reserves of the Czech Republic on the territory of the Czech Republic of the Czech Republic .
The Czech Republic will then , for example , be in favour of the volumes set for mushrooms , for example , which is a heavy fine .
The organisers of this investigation have considered to be an interesting idea of paying money for some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting subsidies .
However , these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague .
The fact that we have no sea has been difficult to do so .
We are going to ask the European Union to pay &apos; .
It would be a good thing for the state of affairs , because of our wheat production , to be able to be able to export , as a result of the fact that the state has been able to export it .
According to <unk> , the EU should have paid millions of euros , because the Czech Republic is far from the ports .
At the end of the day , the European Commission has responded positively to the Czech request and to tender to tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access .
Subsidies for the granting of subsidies have been proposed to the municipalities by the local Ministry of Development led by Minister <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , in concrete terms , in practice , to make applications for subsidies granted by Brussels .
The EU is saying that there is no doubt about the fact that there are a few strange regulations .
If the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States , according to many experts , the EU &apos;s efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the European Union and in the field of its general development , deserve praise .
More importantly , for example , according to experts , the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects which have nothing to do with strengthening European integration , but which have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations .
The fact that the Czech Republic should , like other countries of the Union , fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products ( the fight which it does not always win ) is causing great emotion among the Czechs .
If the Germans and the Austrians have been fought after six years , the Czechs have successfully defended the name &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; , for the name &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; , which goes back home in the 19th century , our producers had to replace it with the name &apos; <unk> &apos; .
Only sugar products of sugar cane , rather than sugar beet , can be used as rum .
In the official list of the EU &apos;s registered products , the <unk> <unk> or Parma ham , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; ) .
<unk> <unk> <unk> ( &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; ) and the <unk> called &apos; <unk> &apos; ( &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; ) can also be proud of their Community mark .
People want me to save the Republic , but I am only an amateur , and it is a <unk> .
Mr <unk> , how is the idea of the presidential elections to be held ?
It is not a matter of being Senator or the President who counts for me .
If everything works without problems in our country , I would not be a candidate .
However , I do not want to see the country being plundered over the last 20 years , that thieves are not being held in the way and taxes and retirement age are increasing .
I did not have the ambition to become a politician .
However , when I see something that I do not like , then I am trying to provide a solution so that it will change .
And as I have more than forty years and I am independent , a member of no party , I do not have any other solutions to influence the situation than to come to the presidential or <unk> elections .
You have entered the Senate , but you have quickly put it into the Senate .
Do you not turn our backs on those who elected you ?
I have always said that I will go into the battle for <unk> according to the results of the elections .
Subsequently , I made it clear that if I was elected in Senator , I would be in the presidential elections .
My aim is not to do so , it is only an instrument that will allow me to achieve my vision .
That is why I need the greatest and the widest mandate .
The problem is not only that , as a nation , we will be <unk> in the bar or in our television position , but it is also that we are <unk> those who try to bring about change .
In addition , there is the press that is destroying the reputation of people and confusing freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
In my opinion , for example , I have been saying that I would like the journalists or I was the adviser of <unk> <unk> .
Turning to your visions .
You have started the fight for <unk> with the horse of political and criminal liability of politicians and tax statements beyond 20 million &#91; <unk> &#93; .
To this end , you must change the law .
As President , you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws .
How do you want to solve this problem ?
When , as a citizen , I have put pressure on the tourist guide to be a liberal profession , I have won the cause .
The problem is the <unk> : when someone comes from left or right with a good project , it is deliberately denied and delaying the people .
As an independent member of no party , I have much more chance of obtaining the support of all parliamentary parties .
I have the advantage of being able to take every party of what is best for our country and to implement it .
Do you look rather like a right-wing man or the left ?
From a Czech point of view , I have the impression that people put me on the left .
As far as I am concerned , it is a little on the left or the right , it is not really important .
For me , the important thing is that we are moving forward .
What counts for me is not that people are left on the left or on the right but to bring people together .
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good , even though it is proposed by the Communist Party or <unk> , and I am equally impartial against bad ideas .
Is you going to say that you are a populist ?
But what did you say about it .
When you have a business plan in a business , you also have an optimum aim and a vision .
You are trying to bring it closer to you .
Some can call it populism , but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and the experts recognised in this respect .
However , without Parliament &apos;s support , you have just slogans .
It is a long time for us to do so in politics .
Do you think that if you are going to see people and talk about them , you will succeed , for example , to impose material and criminal responsibility ?
I have no other option .
I must convince the politicians , journalists and public opinion and try to bring them to my side in order to impose it .
If I was elected President , it would not be a problem of <unk> on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on material and criminal liability of politicians , officials , judges and prosecutors .
Then they should explain why they do not want them .
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse , it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene .
Take the election of the President by direct suffrage , for example , with the pressure of public opinion .
I must confess that it is an amateur , not a <unk> or an intellectual .
I am trying to find allies with my views and visions .
I have just started in politics , and I am trying to obtain majority support for my programme .
I am trying to make progress , and if it does not work , I will stop in six years &apos; time , and I will return to the private sector .
It is a bit as if it were to save the Czech Republic .
I am not a <unk> .
I know that there is only one person who can make a difference , which is why I went to see a number of figures to ask them to present themselves to the <unk> elections .
I met <unk> <unk> , but he refused because of the amount of work .
At least , I have supported the journalist of <unk> <unk> , who has revealed the oil fraud .
I have come up because people are really dissatisfied with this , but I have no hesitation .
Sixty per cent of people did not vote , and what has been done has , for the most part , given their voice to a representative of the establishment .
In the Senate , we are only two self-employed .
People have elected a Senate who will be able to impose changes .
In spite of everything , I would like to see my vision , for example , the direct election of mayors and <unk> of regions .
Do you intend to base your own party ?
No , not yet , because I do not have the time to check whether the past of each potential member is <unk> and then I do not have the financial resources .
Nor do I have any money for my presidential campaign , but I have only 20 thousand on my own point of view &apos; transparent &apos; .
Do you have no money ?
You are talking about tax statements , and what is you talking about ?
In my view , the value of my personal assets is about 60 million .
In Prague , I have a value of 25 million , a piece of value of 10 million , another piece of <unk> , a collection of art works of around 10 million , a <unk> Martin that is worth 3.5 million and a <unk> <unk> of a value of 1 million and a few million on my account .
Incidentally , I have a <unk> Martin , because it was a dream of <unk> : I have always liked James <unk> , who was <unk> by car , was <unk> with women and fighting against the evil and abuse .
Will you be <unk> Martin , and you have a heritage of a value of 60 million and you have no money for your campaign ?
Do you want to change the Republic , but do you want to invest your own money .
It is not very convincing .
I do not have 15 million for this campaign .
I would like to say that I should like to say that I should like to have a debt of debt ?
I have invested EUR 2 million in the countryside .
The fact that I do not have any <unk> shows that there is a great deal of interest in my programme .
I do not have the obligation to pay for this campaign in my pocket .
On the whole hand , my campaign is covered by the pay that I will receive as a Senator .
However , I could not live in this way , for example , to pay the English school for my son , which costs a thousand thousand per month .
If my only objective was to gain money , I will not be voting on any election .
So , are you going to continue with your business in order to live in order to live ?
Did you not say that you are going to do so in a bad way .
However , this is not linked to the amount of remuneration .
As I promised , I have partially reduced my activities .
For example , my deputy will take the lead of the travel agency in the spring .
People would like me to be a <unk> who save the Republic .
However , there is something to do with me .
What was the usual monthly salary when you were involved ?
I would like to say that I am going to win between the two hundred and four hundred thousand .
If I was President , I would put an end to my commercial activities .
There will be an interview in the edition of the newspaper in the newspaper .
The architects of the <unk> cabinet show that the real adventures is not only about imagination , and it is enough to look at the <unk> and the <unk> of new books - 2 <unk> .
I think that this building is <unk> , and it is very <unk> , finally , something interesting to say &apos; , we say <unk> <unk> , a <unk> on the streets of the street .
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> in a large neighbouring company , tells us : &apos; Yes , it is indeed fine , this building &apos; .
However , I wonder why there is still a need for a library .
Everyone has the Internet , a <unk> and <unk> .
Today , no one is going to be very happy in one of these <unk> libraries .
<unk> , a <unk> which is not attractive to Rotterdam , has a very particular record .
The <unk> of the Netherlands has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands .
In order to restore a few <unk> to the brain , the city decided , a few years ago , to contribute to the general culture and to repeat the seven shadow bridges which appear on the euro notes in the form of small <unk> <unk> .
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited .
In this way , the authorities in the city have realised that there is only one way of resuming the statistics : the construction of a library !
<unk> <unk> , from the architects of Rotterdam of Rotterdam , master <unk> in a bold and creative way of the spirit and often cynical , <unk> the project with its usual and <unk> <unk> in 2003 with five pounds and a <unk> on the face .
At the same time as the jury , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> books by order of size to make it a pyramid , and <unk> his speech based on political arguments by one : &apos; dear common ! &apos;
That is what my proposal for the <unk> of books , or as we say , is the case of <unk> .
Nine years later , the mountain of EUR 30 million has been <unk> .
The building is part of a revitalisation project , which also includes an underground car , a supermarket , a post office and a few <unk> houses and houses for a total of 50 homes .
At the beginning of November , the mountain of books received the second &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; .
In addition , the project was selected for the National <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This small <unk> , which until now had nothing more to offer than a <unk> <unk> area , and a city of an astonishing <unk> , whose <unk> would call on think that they have a <unk> , has enriched itself from contemporary architectural work .
The most important thing is that <unk> now has the first public cultural edifice in its history .
There is a long way to go .
The first impression is that there is a <unk> of the book in cheese .
Of course , a lift is being transported at the heart of the mass , but the real joy of reading and architecture is open to you when you <unk> the building of the building to the discovery of its <unk> .
There is a glass of glass and a clear glass of <unk> , and there is no doubt that there is a point of view of the ground of the Dutch <unk> and <unk> .
The urban atmosphere is perfect .
We are already seeking to look at public services , dogs and small boys who are playing the ball .
All books , books and books are books .
Normally , the library &apos;s shelves are a long one , and in the middle is a big and dark Chamber , which is often uncomfortable and <unk> &apos; .
We have completely shaken the traditional and open space of the internal space of the home .
In the middle of the mountain of books , in the middle of the <unk> , the Internet , the Internet , the failure club , the environmental centre and the technical power station in the building .
A special beauty lies in the black shelves of the library , which are sometimes <unk> , sometimes <unk> , sometimes <unk> .
There is a new experience with regard to it , it will affect it .
Even the architects and engineers of the <unk> building do not want unknown materials .
We wanted to work with recycled materials &apos; , as a result of the <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; .
This is the way in which we have found an ad hoc waste in an agricultural company which has come from agriculture .
In the Netherlands , it has been used for years of the synthetic <unk> of a <unk> <unk> as a <unk> in the <unk> and fields .
It is cheap , and there is a lot of time .
The end of the day is used for one or two seasons and then we can throw it out .
For the library , the <unk> has been <unk> , for the first time in such quantities , for the first time , in the case of a large number of centimetres .
Under the effect of heat and pressure , the &apos; <unk> &apos; ( <unk> ) is changing colour and turning into a dark , homogenous and resistant material , which is the smell of both a new car and sports shoes .
At the top of the 105 <unk> , there is a mountain summit .
After almost 500 metres , literary coffee offers us a <unk> view of the city , but also of Dutch <unk> and <unk> .
The latter are creating an atmosphere , but they are , in particular , in order to maintain the ideal of the quality of the air of literary mountains .
<unk> for the soul
It is incredible , but in spite of all the glass areas , this building is a model for the ecology of the environment .
The temperature of the building has been settled by a <unk> .
Even the mountains of books are below a glass of glass , the sun will only be in the middle of the day , even the long time .
The <unk> <unk> in timber has been <unk> by means of the glass of glass as a <unk> , a <unk> of a large proportion of the shelves .
There is a very pleasant atmosphere in the atmosphere .
There is no doubt about the fact that they are being <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> mentioned , has already risked to enter the new library .
<unk> , too , was there .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> of Chinese medicine , even describes the <unk> as &apos; the <unk> &apos; of <unk> .
A few weeks ago , during the opening , every citizen was invited to donate a book from his own library .
This measure has made it possible to bridge the loopholes in the library that was not yet completely <unk> , which is now GBP <unk> .
The concept is a success .
<unk> on all sides .
For the architect <unk> <unk> , &apos; there is nothing worse than an empty library &apos; .
I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building .
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building .
Even if it is only for <unk> .
This is how <unk> has reached the main discipline that is called , in professional jargon , &apos; the creation of an identity &apos; .
<unk> wrote a new page of literary history .
Even though it may appear young and not educated .
Finally , it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity .
<unk> : &apos; Germans must play a greater role .
Germany has chosen to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State .
According to Stephen <unk> , an expert of relations between the United States and the EU , this decision puts Berlin into a delicate political situation .
Deutsche <unk> : at the beginning of the week , Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain the status of state observer at the United Nations .
But then it has chosen to abstain .
Why is that so ?
Stephen <unk> : Germany does not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
However , Berlin must be cautious because it has special relations with Israel .
However , I also believe that it does not support the American position either .
Germany wanted to assert its independence , but it must not be too critical of Israel .
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone .
Finally , NATO will be able to do so .
Will Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on the major international issues ?
The answer is yes .
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its external policy , seeking to move away from a policy as defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy .
In addition , the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation .
The Germans are facing a number of fronts .
They are expected to play a more independent role , but they are not used to them .
I believe that they will still be able to find this role , but are on the road to a more normal foreign policy .
A foreign policy , as in France or in the United Kingdom .
What does it mean in concrete terms of the term &apos; normal &apos; foreign policy for Germans ?
It shows the willingness to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and of the European partners , including with regard to national matters .
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy , therefore by exports and relations with certain regions , such as Russia , China or the Middle East .
The German economic interests are , to a certain extent , different from those of the other major powers : that is why Germany must protect its interests .
Have these economic interests influenced the position of Germany with regard to the Middle East conflict and abstained from the United Nations vote ?
First of all , Germany has major opportunities for the Middle East , especially in the Gulf countries .
That is why Berlin must be careful not to interfere with public opinion , but also the elites of the Arab countries .
There is no doubt that this is a crucial factor .
However , I do not think there is too much importance here , because it is not a purely unilateral relationship .
But this is a crucial element in German strategic considerations .
Will Germany be in its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes , as in the case of Palestine ?
I believe that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position .
That is why I believe that the divide is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question .
It may even be possible for Germany to be respected .
In fact , Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account .
In Europe , opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different .
On the other hand , the United States has announced a clear voice of veto .
Does the views of the United States and the majority of European countries have a great deal of view ?
There have always been differences because of the American internal political scene .
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly demonstrating a great understanding of the European position .
However , given the political configuration of the country , the government cannot , of course , defend its public position .
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem to be .
If you look at relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu , you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiasm for Netanyahu &apos;s policy .
Will Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States , on the one hand , with the position of the major European partners , on the other ?
I think that it does not make things easier for the Germans .
Of course , it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy , but today it is not .
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must assert their special position .
That is what they are doing at present in the euro issue .
In my opinion , Germany will take a leading role in the future and will drive Europe into a European position .
It is not easy for Germany , particularly because of relations with Israel .
This has always been a delicate issue .
In my opinion , however , the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a part of their independence .
Is Germany playing a role as a major player on the international stage , and does Germany want to play a key role ?
Or does it still have difficulties with a leading role ?
Germany is still not used to it , it is always uncomfortable and , for obvious reasons , the country still has difficulties to play a greater role .
If we look at the euro crisis , for example , we note that every time Germany decides to influence more , many <unk> sentiments are being heard .
It does not make things easier for the Germans .
In fact , it is always the same problem : we do not want to be <unk> from hostile countries .
From this point of view , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States .
It has to deal with different neighbours and opinions , and it is not easy .
Today , the influence of the United States on European policy is being reduced , but at the moment the EU does not fill this gap , which remains ?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role .
Even if they do not like them , they do not like them , but if they are less appreciated , it is life !
Stephen <unk> is the deputy director of the <unk> <unk> in Washington , an institute in which academics and experts in Europe and North America are analysing the challenges of the transatlantic community .
<unk> is also a member of the <unk> Marshall <unk> , where he is in a German foreign policy , in US foreign policy and in transatlantic relations .
Protection of trademarks in China : when <unk>
<unk> and Polo <unk> <unk> are known throughout the world .
<unk> Polo ... what is really about ?
Behind the name of this name , it is officially signed in China , but it has nothing to do with the original company .
In this way , there is a guarantee of protection such as the company that is the name of a complaint .
Even if it could be able to do so , it is not sure that it would win the cause .
<unk> is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China &apos; , as Mr <unk> <unk> , a lawyer of <unk> Taylor , in violation of property rights in the Far East .
Every week , a new dossier comes to my office .
<unk> only need a few more letters so that they can register their brands .
In this way , instead of <unk> , there is <unk> , and instead of <unk> .
German companies are also legally copy , as <unk> , the manufacturer of sports products .
It opens up a <unk> in which the recordings made in the Beijing <unk> Office are found .
On 14 September 2010 , a Chinese company tabled the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a name that the firm artificially created by <unk> part of the name of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> house .
It is known that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and the violation of intellectual property .
In the large cities , there are different commercial centres that can only be sold to counterfeiting .
The cases of <unk> are , however , different : his own people are responsible for tackling the fact that the Chinese World Trade Office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country .
The Chinese is talking about &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; , a <unk> mark .
The word is &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; .
It is with this end that women are appointed to get to rich men .
The Chinese authorities are saying that they have nothing to blame for .
This is bad for business , and we need to combat this trend &apos; , and we need to combat this &apos; trend .
The mark has been watered down , and it has been watered down , and the damage to the reputation is enormous .
Financial losses and justice costs amount amount to millions for the sectors concerned , especially with regard to expensive expensive products .
According to the data of the <unk> market analysis , China represents , with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion , the third world market for luxury products and the development of the fastest developing world .
However , it is not easy to <unk> the dubious recordings of the trademarks register and these procedures are expensive .
They can continue until nine years ago , and the outcome is never a good one .
In the case of the trial , the Court rejected the complaint , because after a long period of time , the <unk> was a &apos; market reality &apos; .
Let us explain that if the complainant does not have a chance , it can even be obliged to pay money to the <unk> , because it would have damaged its mark in China .
In this area , it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates .
There are a number of <unk> cases in which there are <unk> .
In 2009 , <unk> had lost a legal battle against the <unk> shipyard manufacturer , the same company that had just bought the <unk> <unk> .
That is why the Chinese can use an emblem which looks like a Mercedes .
<unk> , the <unk> of Volvo , used before a blue and white logo which recalled that of BMW , the conflict was settled and will change it .
The <unk> house had lost the <unk> of Hong Kong and Singapore in the opposite direction .
According to the Chinese authorities , they are guilty of nothing .
However , in Beijing , we have had a great deal of difficulties with a lack of staff in Beijing because of a lack of staff and space .
However , last year , the office would have passed a &apos; emergency situation in the course of the work to a <unk> normality &apos; .
For example , the number of unwanted opposition procedures would have fallen by 22 % .
Almost <unk> cases of this kind would have been closed , which is an increase of 75 % compared with the previous year .
Nevertheless , there are still still outstanding procedures for the office .
<unk> costs
As in China , the figures are impressive .
Last year , the <unk> has received more than 1.4 million requests for marks , almost one third of more than in 2010 .
According to the office , this is a record , and that means that China is for the tenth time in the head of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world .
It would also be the case of the total number of legal marks , which is EUR 5.5 million .
In 2011 , the office would have had EUR 1.8 billion of the right to be registered .
In other words , every registration reported on average <unk> , or EUR 160 .
There is a lot more than a legal battle , as illustrated by the case of the German family company .
For more than seven years , the company has been fighting against a Chinese <unk> .
Of course , the Germans have been able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended .
However , the <unk> has been able to maintain its Chinese rights on the <unk> mark .
It is our fault , because the names of the family cannot be protected in Germany &apos; , explain <unk> <unk> , President of <unk> <unk> <unk> in Munich .
It has therefore rejected the objection of <unk> .
It is true that it has been won by both the following two bodies , but the opposition is continuing to fight until now .
There is a need for vigilance
Today , the matter is a matter for the Supreme Court .
<unk> , he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of judges .
Nevertheless , it adds : &apos; The procedure is long , demanding , and we cost a lot of time and money &apos; .
It is also difficult to evaluate the internal costs , and the archives has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years to provide evidence .
Five years ago , <unk> was even proposed in vain to the other side of a &apos; large sum in euros to six figures &apos; to settle the dispute .
That is what we see as a result of what this represents for us to do .
The dangers of the Far East are even threatening to go into Europe .
This would be the case if the <unk> of the region has been used for the use of unprotected brands .
For example , a Chinese producer wanted to submit in Germany the name of <unk> for a footwear and leather company .
For a long time , the company has abandoned this sector , but it was able to prevent it from tabling .
Let us add to it : &apos; vigilance is being made &apos; .
<unk> and advise the German companies to be very careful in their trade relations with China .
It is not enough , according to them , to rely on the international law of trademarks , foreigners should rather be &apos; register in China as well as that may be protected &apos; , as <unk> says .
Otherwise , the costs can be much more important than registration .
Indeed , if <unk> lost the battle in the last act of its legal tragedy , the company should pay licence rights to the opposing side for the use of its own name , as the <unk> is explained .
Or then we would lose our place on the market segment in question .
World AIDS Day : let us sing , let us sing , let us sing , and let us sing .
The <unk> <unk> repeat in <unk> , and the AIDS orphans in Swaziland are pleased to come .
This is the history of a link that is much more than a distance of <unk> kilometres .
First of all , we are <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> for men and <unk> for men are looking at the pace of the ground , and very quickly they find them .
One , two , three , four .
Secondly , the voices of the <unk> are growing slowly - <unk> , low , <unk> and <unk> - and they take precedence and follow .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> of 29 years is losing almost his shoes when he takes the orchestra with his gestures of savage flexibility .
On Monday evening , the <unk> <unk> repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
Fifty <unk> and <unk> of 23 to 69 years came from the <unk> in human medicine .
<unk> <unk> &apos; is not an easy piece , every <unk> has different words , all in a very exotic language : <unk> , a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland .
To be helped to help to help them to help
<unk> , the United Nations programme on AIDS , considers that 34 million people throughout the world are suffering from the disease .
In southern Africa , we are living in southern Africa .
There are a number of people who are infected with the people who are infected .
In addition , more than 40 % of the population is <unk> .
The <unk> of the village of <unk> of the village of <unk> found sponsors in Germany through the &apos; <unk> for Africa &apos; association .
There are 70 of them in the field of secondary education .
For EUR 15 or EUR 20 per less , we can become <unk> .
This is a result of the use of the child of money for the school , a school standard and a daily meal at the centre of <unk> .
<unk> means in <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; or &apos; <unk> &apos; .
No one can speak in a common language in this region , but everyone can sing it .
For almost 10 years , the <unk> has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has led to Germany in order to make it to its home region : South Africa .
Because of <unk> kilometres from the <unk> of <unk> , in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland , there is <unk> , the village that depends on the voice of the German <unk> .
40 % of people
In the village of the village , there are around <unk> , some people live in small <unk> or land and the majority of them are children .
More than 300 of them are orphans , because HIV has won their parents .
In <unk> , we can see on a smaller scale the ills in Swaziland : the highest HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF .
The population can never accept male <unk> , but it is a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of <unk> .
More than 40 % of the population of Swaziland has a <unk> virus , and it is not unusual to die in the middle of the 30 .
At a group trip in Africa in spring 2005 , the <unk> was able to discover the village , and the <unk> have seen many children on the streets who have been lacking not only parental care but simply everything : food , clothing , education .
In a poor country , without school qualifications , there is simply no prospect of this .
At the beginning , it was only a few people who made a personal commitment to pay a few euros every year so that we can send a child to school and to offer him a warm meal per day .
Just a year later , however , the <unk> was based on the &apos; <unk> for Africa &apos; , an association which has been involved in an almost professional manner of AIDS orphans .
On the subject of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common communicable diseases ?
Among the bacteria <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( or <unk> ) are included .
<unk> <unk> are HIV , the <unk> virus , <unk> <unk> or hepatitis .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> belong to the <unk> <unk> .
What are the groups concerned about ?
<unk> and <unk> often appear to be in people who have sexual relations with other men .
The <unk> Institute believes that sexual contacts between men are the cause of at least four cases of <unk> in Germany .
In <unk> adults , <unk> infections , <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> and the human <unk> virus are sexually transmitted diseases .
The spread rate of HIV between <unk> adults is relatively low in Germany , but some 20 % of the new HIV infections are observed in this group .
In young people , there is a rate of infections in relation to <unk> considerably higher than the other population groups .
According to European reports , three quarters of all infections concern young people aged between 15 and 25 .
In addition , in Germany , the virus of the human <unk> is being held with young people .
What is the development of the number of infections ?
It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases .
According to the <unk> Institute , the number of cases of <unk> has more than doubled in 10 years : the figure has risen from <unk> in 2001 to <unk> in 2011 .
Since 2007 , the number of new HIV infections has been reduced .
In 2011 , there have been around <unk> cases .
This is a tenth reduction in the last year .
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease ?
infectious diseases can cause <unk> at the level of genital organs , <unk> pain , <unk> losses , pain to <unk> and the emergence of <unk> and <unk> .
However , there is a lack of pain and no other symptom of any symptom and no other symptom .
How can we protect ourselves ?
condoms can reduce the risk of infection , but they do not protect 100 % .
The reason for this is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by <unk> infection or in close contact .
The experts are therefore recommending that any person who is changing sexual partners often be able to carry out examinations .
Most of the <unk> quickly <unk> can be cured and the late damage can be avoided .
Thanks to the <unk> , donations , but above all the funds that are collected by the <unk> through their votes through the whole of Germany , are accumulating .
At all , we have already sent around EUR EUR <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In the village , <unk> <unk> , a safe woman and who always gets what she wants , manages the money from Germany .
It also ensures that the orphans are well <unk> , for example .
In this way , <unk> are called the old women in <unk> , and they are the pillars of the village .
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans , they provide them with a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniform .
The orphan who no longer has anyone in a safe place at home , in <unk> , a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association , as well as the two <unk> who are preparing meals every day for more than 200 starving children .
In addition , &apos; <unk> for Africa &apos; has created a school of <unk> and the construction of two <unk> , together with the American organisation for Health and <unk> , the association organised a HIV screening test for many inhabitants .
It goes without saying , because even if the disease is visible throughout the country , it remains a taboo subject .
<unk> and <unk>
<unk> is a real taboo &apos; , which is why it is a matter of <unk> <unk> : &apos; because it is a matter of sexuality &apos; .
It is quite strange that , from a country whose King has 14 official wives , have been official .
The last absolute <unk> of black Africa , King <unk> III , is known for his excessive lifestyle .
<unk> on the basis of democracy .
It is the case of the state of affairs that has been sanctioned by the state of affairs for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades .
migrant workers have also <unk> the virus through the country .
There are , however , a number of condoms in the street of the street , and it adds <unk> <unk> , but it is not used to do so .
Culture is a different one of them .
In order to promote a little of the cultural exchange , the <unk> of <unk> are working together on both or three years in southern Africa and <unk> of nostalgia , courage , confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the black continent are still living in apartheid .
It is a sign of recognition that it does not only create good humour and joy , but sometimes it is a sign of a few <unk> <unk> .
The bus is still taking them in <unk> , where they are visiting their <unk> .
Even though it is difficult to find a small village on a map , it is well known in the <unk> Valley .
<unk> to <unk> , you will find out of the light &apos; , say the people there .
After a trip from <unk> kilometres to the flight of bird , back to <unk> , to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , there is also light .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> the ice .
There has been evidence of the existence of ice on the planet on the <unk> world .
The ice of the ice could reach 20 metres .
The United States Space Agency has proved to be the case of ice on the <unk> planet .
Although this planet is closest to <unk> , it contains frozen water , as has been explained by three studies published on Thursday in the &apos; Science &apos; &apos; Science &apos; .
There has been evidence of the existence of ice coverage in the world of the world , which has been constantly in the shadow of the world .
This coverage would have a huge thickness of at least 30 centimetres .
Water is likely to come from <unk> or perhaps <unk> .
However , there is no link between the discovery of water and the assumption of a living life on the planet , which is why the scientist of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The temperature on <unk> can reach <unk> degrees .
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have reached in other areas of the solar system .
<unk> the people of our planet , <unk> , <unk> and small <unk> like <unk> <unk> the depths of the universe .
At the same time , they are sending images to the earth , such as small <unk> through which there is an infinite amount of time .
The image of the European Institute from the <unk> Institute has come from a <unk> apparatus .
The <unk> of our solar system , as well as the <unk> planet , is <unk> .
As Mr <unk> , who is <unk> around the <unk> behind <unk> , <unk> is not regarded as a &apos; planet &apos; , according to the new definition of the <unk> EU of 2006 .
This detail of a <unk> photograph taken by the <unk> <unk> shows a &apos; family image &apos; of the countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are blue and the <unk> , more difficult to identify , are the &apos; babies &apos; in the <unk> Chamber .

However , it is more important to put colours on the table .
On this <unk> photograph , the <unk> of <unk> , as a red eye , is a <unk> one .
It is 700 years away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
Its <unk> with a land continent has been given him the title of North America .
The combination of the normal photograph and the <unk> photograph makes it possible to observe a spectacular <unk> .
Only the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been able to catch a picture of the new star in all its beauty .
One of the biggest <unk> of the <unk> is about the creation of <unk> rings .
There is a theory that there is a <unk> of <unk> , which has disappeared over a few years ago , without trace .
One of the most important and net photographs taken by the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
According to the <unk> , the photographs of <unk> <unk> may become true works of art .
The photograph published by the European Monitoring Centre shows that the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of many thousand years .
The name of <unk> comes from the Latin word &apos; <unk> &apos; ( divided , shared in three ) , because three dust <unk> the <unk> heart of the place of birth of stars .
<unk> have <unk> the beginnings of a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> : to 400 million years away from the Earth , the <unk> of two <unk> in fusion and collision is inevitable .
<unk> <unk> observed the birth of these stars in the <unk> spiral .
If you do not like the technical <unk> , you can use his name as a &apos; Southern <unk> &apos; .
The picture of the <unk> space picture shows a detailed detail about the <unk> of the <unk> .
There is a lack of confusion in the light of the <unk> of dust , and it is made up of dust of dust , which is ten hundred times smaller than the normal domestic dust .
This photograph has been drawn up from the optical and <unk> clichés taken by various <unk> .
We can see that the circle of black holes of the black holes of 430 million years away from the earth .
In the case of NASA , this group of <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , has been <unk> .
Scientists have appointed the largest spiral of <unk> <unk> .
In this vague <unk> group of the European Union , the most light of the <unk> of our <unk> .
The <unk> cradle always gives rise to new stars .
These clouds of stars , which are linked by the <unk> of <unk> , are also constantly creating young stars in <unk> away from the earth .
In this <unk> and the breakthrough of a small black hole , there are still no dust , there is only gas .
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the <unk> , when the universe was a large part of hydrogen .
We look at the universe of the world :
The <unk> would have been invented by Hans <unk> , before Galileo was a year to observe the stars .
Since then , the <unk> of the optical <unk> have not ceased to grow and , thanks to them , it has been possible to see even further in the universe .
For 30 years , between 1947 and 1975 , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> Centre for Mount <unk> near San <unk> was the world &apos;s largest <unk> .
The mirror of this image was a <unk> of five metres .
In the United States , in the United States , there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It makes it possible to observe the universe of the world through two <unk> , with each other .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in La <unk> , in the Canary Islands , is immense , and it is a mirror of <unk> metres .
The mirror of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in South Africa was <unk> to make savings .
There is a total of around 11 metres .
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the <unk> is set at vertical level , which restricts mobility .
<unk> <unk> in Texas is also set at vertical level .
It is a matter of great capacity to collect light .
Despite a relatively small mirror of the mirror , this capacity is being brought closer to those of the largest <unk> in the world .
Scientists are listening to the universe in search for <unk> signals with the help of the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .
This <unk> has a <unk> of EUR <unk> .
Anyone who owns a computer can help the &apos; <unk> for <unk> <unk> &apos; ( <unk> , or &apos; search for <unk> intelligence &apos; ) by making the power of calculating his machine .
In view of the Southern European Monitoring Centre ( <unk> ) , in Chile .
Here is the <unk> <unk> <unk> ( &apos; very great <unk> &apos; ) , a plant which is worthy of its name .
Thanks to a total of four mirrors , this <unk> can shed light on the average spectrum of spectrum .
The construction of a very large European <unk> ( European <unk> <unk> ) is also planned for the <unk> site in Chile .
The main mirror of 42 metres is to be achieved in the main mirror , and it will be composed of almost <unk> elements .
However , the <unk> will not be able to take clichés before 2018 as soon as possible .
Until 2007 , the two <unk> of <unk> on the volcano <unk> of the <unk> <unk> were considered to be the largest in the world .
There are two <unk> of a <unk> of 10 metres .

There should also be a great deal of <unk> to be built on the <unk> <unk> and the diameter of its mirror .
This is an example of admiration for this .
However , the images of the most important space of the area come from the <unk> space .
Since 24 April 1990 , we have had the pictures of the past .
Since March 2009 , the <unk> space has been seeking <unk> , mainly those which are <unk> .
<unk> has announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found <unk> <unk> candidate from the start of the mission .
This picture illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the <unk> space <unk> .
The <unk> space space ( <unk> ) will be sent into space at the earliest stage in 2018 on board a <unk> <unk> .
The first mirror of the <unk> space of space has a <unk> of 6.5 metres .
The task of the <unk> will be to find the light of the first stars and <unk> after the <unk> .
Scientists believe that the south of <unk> also has the ice of the ice .
However , there is no reliable data on this theory , because it is far more close to the northern pole of <unk> .
For decades , there have been ice on the <unk> of ice for decades .
Thanks to the launch of the <unk> <unk> in 2004 , the first to <unk> around <unk> , scientists now have certainty .
On a daily basis , let us live in butter and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan , many people are reaching ages worthy of the Bible .
There is still a life museum in which there is a life .
There is an investigation into a country where it is still relatively young .
In the south of Azerbaijan , many people are reaching ages worthy of the Bible .
There is still a life museum in which there is a life .
There is an investigation into a country where it is still relatively young .
The journey in <unk> mountains is a <unk> <unk> .
As a result of the many points of the road , the small bus , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> rivers and small farms .
Everything is green and fertile , and it would be almost <unk> .
But we are here in the south of Azerbaijan , the border with Iran only a few kilometres .
This is where the ethnic ethnic group is living in the name of <unk> , on which we do not know very much , if they are simply talking about the <unk> and the <unk> and that they have a great longevity .
<unk> : <unk> .
There is a small city <unk> with its own aggressive architecture of the Soviet era , which does not agree with the <unk> mountain landscape .
European tourists are rare here , the journey since the capital of Azerbaijan , in the capital of Azerbaijan , is far too difficult .
There is a need for eight hours to travel to the <unk> .
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea .
However , <unk> <unk> , 48 years , is convinced that <unk> has the potential to become a tourist place .
<unk> has become famous in May thanks to the aid of the <unk> , and next year there will be the most old festival of the oldest people in the world .
It is a guideline of the life museum , the only museum in the world .
We can find out the lives of about eight dozens of <unk> of the region that have more than 100 years old , and we are showing a black and white picture .
This is my grandfather , he has reached the age of 120 .
Having a child in 136 .
However , the controversial <unk> of the museum is <unk> <unk> , who would have had 168 years .
However , there is no birth of birth .
When we think that the oldest person in the old person in the past , the age of <unk> seems to be more than dubious .
It was born in <unk> in this region , who died in 1973 , and he died in 1973 .
Man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children , and at the age of 136 , he would have devised a daughter .
Would it be a mistake for us to make a mistake of a few decades &apos; time to make a mistake of his age ?
<unk> Scholz , <unk> to the <unk> Institute of <unk> , has also heard about man in Central Asia .
<unk> people are also living in certain areas of China , Japan or the <unk> Valley in Pakistan &apos; , is a <unk> , &apos; in Sardinia too , there are men who live incredibly old .
However , it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the lack of documents , and there was no civil state register .
Every day , we have a glass of butter .
However , it is true that people in the <unk> region often reach a dignified age of the Bible .
At the moment , there are more than 100 people who have more than 100 years old .
What is the reason for life in the south of that country ?
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> tourist guide , explains that the <unk> have particular genes .
On the other hand , <unk> , the Director-General of the museum , believes that this is a food issue .
However , it does not seem plausible , from a nutritional point of view , that <unk> meals , who like meat , bread and , above all , dairy products , many of which drink a glass of <unk> butter , are good for health .
Either it is a simple way of life that preserves the young people &apos; s young people , and in <unk> , a tiny village close to the city of <unk> , live <unk> <unk> .
With its 97 years , it is still relatively young for the region .
<unk> , who says that he has 143 descendants , lives in a small house of wood , as it is typical of this throughout the Caucasus region .
It is on the ground on the ground alongside a <unk> , and it is a matter of constant content .
Eight people live here in a single roof , including one of the sons of <unk> and a girl who has long been adults .
There are two small children in the home .
In the kitchen , it is being prepared for tea for the guests to be used in typical glasses in the form of <unk> .
The white teeth of <unk> are fully aligned , and under its headscarf hiding long <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that his son reveals with pride .
I have always <unk> my hair with milk , and that is how I have never lost them and that they have kept their colour .
The &apos; I have never used &apos; , and it adds <unk> .
The monthly pension is sufficient for us to live in the future .
It has always eaten what comes from his own firm : tomatoes , potatoes and small <unk> .
In my life , I have never bought the slightest food in a supermarket .
Secondly , it talks about her husband who was in the army .
The worst time was after the Second World War .
However , everything has improved when the &apos; <unk> father &apos; <unk> Aliyev took orders .
The language of propaganda is astonishing in the mouth of an old lady .
However , the cult of the <unk> <unk> of the nation , a man who has , however , led to his country as a dictator , almost no limits in Azerbaijan .
It was in power until 2003 , his son <unk> him .
In any case , the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress .
<unk> receives <unk> 230 <unk> ( around the same amount as in euros ) for his retirement , a sum that guarantees a good train in the region .
And perhaps the son for a long time of time has been right : &apos; the elderly enjoy great respect in our culture &apos; .
They are the centre of the great family , they are loved , treated and happy .
This is a good reason to live as long as possible .
Human rights omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is coming out of Cairo .
<unk> demonstrations reveal the deep divide in the country .
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is highly controversial .
The Egyptian President is not <unk> enough of emotion .
We must succeed in the transition .
&quot; And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God &apos; , he said on state television .
His speech was aimed at the whole people , but above all the Christian Christians , the Liberals , enlightened and secular Muslims .
Because all the members of the <unk> and <unk> opposition are afraid .
They are afraid of a theocracy in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood .
Mohamed <unk> said , almost in favour , having temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his &apos; in order to save the revolution &apos; .
However , the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this engineer is to save this engineer of 61 years , the holder of a PhD from the American university of California .
Will the judiciary be reversed ?
The 234 articles which were written by the <unk> assembly of 100 people in the night of 15 hours are indeed worrying to some extent .
As in previous constitutions , the project stipulates that the law is based on &apos; the principles of Islamic law &apos; .
But what does the word &apos; principles &apos; really mean ?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation , and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the legal room for manoeuvre which is due to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law .
In any case , a new article that states that , as far as all Sharia issues are concerned , the <unk> University must be consulted , and the establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its <unk> over the Islamic Muslim world .
This can be said , but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus , which would lead to the rule of law .
There are many points in the draft Constitution in the draft .
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction .
During the course of Mubarak , these courts are <unk> to suppress opponents .
After the fall of the dictator , up to <unk> civilians were detained by the military .
The state must also be able to protect &apos; the true nature of the Egyptian family &apos; and &apos; promote its morality and values &apos; .
From a legal point of view , the wording is so vague that the state institutions can even control the content of the <unk> art and literature .
To make it clear , it would simply be censorship .
In addition , there is no explicit guarantee of equality between men and women .
Instead , there is another article which prohibits any offence or <unk> the prophet Mohammed or his envoys .
On the other hand , the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished .
Equally dubious is the wording that it is forbidden to say that &apos; offend &apos; people &apos; .
Is it a question of a caricature of the President or a joke to the detriment of a man of law ?
There are , therefore , many points in interpretation in the draft which is being put to the vote and which , according to its own words , will be the subject of a referendum to the Egyptians .
The <unk> revolution
The opposition has been committed to the digital superiority of the Islamists for weeks .
On Friday evening , tens of thousands of demonstrators came together in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo , promising to bring Sharia law into force before it comes into force .
The revolution is going on , and we are going to win &apos; , and we are going to win &apos; , which is a third one to the presidential elections .
The Nobel Peace Prize and <unk> of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is &apos; to throw history &apos; .
On Twitter , the <unk> service , it has accused the supporters of <unk> to try to promote a &apos; coup against democracy &apos; .
If he declared the referendum , he will go to his palace , and he will be <unk> &apos; , and he is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We are not yet tired , the blood of our brothers is not yet <unk> &apos; , in accordance with the Egyptian media <unk> Ali , a politician and a member of the opposition .
In addition , a number of judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum , which would lead to the end of the vote .
The Koran is our Constitution
For its part , the Muslim <unk> , well-organised , called for a <unk> not on Tahrir Square by a precautionary measure , but on the other side of the <unk> , where a great prayer was held at the University of Cairo .
<unk> women and the supporters of <unk> , who participated in many , <unk> : &apos; the people are calling for the application of God &apos;s law &apos; .
<unk> our country ! &apos; , <unk> in <unk> , saying that &apos; the Koran &#91; was their &#93; Constitution &apos; .
A fight for sovereignty on the symbolic <unk> <unk> , where all <unk> , would soon have created a situation similar to that of civil war .
Obviously , it is what the supporters of <unk> wanted to avoid .
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opponents of the draft Constitution , as well as his supporters , expressed loud and strong .
According to them , it is now time to allow the people to decide on the way in which the country is to vote .
There will certainly be a majority in the project of the Islamists .
Human rights are not mentioned once again .
<unk> Abu <unk> is angry against this imposed constitutional process which should have been extended until February and include all social forces .
This <unk> human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation ( <unk> ) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak .
He did so not because he shared their view of the world , but because for him human rights are indivisible .
That is why it was <unk> and imprisoned .
The word &apos; now , the word is not even in the new Constitution &apos; , <unk> during his interview with the <unk> .
Extending the powers of <unk> to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer .
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt .
Instead of strengthening civil society , the President does not de facto have any powers to do so .
However , a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations .
It is the case of the international community , including by the international community , who is looking at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the <unk> with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness .
This could be done .
There is a warning of a demonstration on the <unk> Square : &apos; You are <unk> of a monster that it will no longer be possible to control .
Is the <unk> of Norway : is it the most <unk> fish in the world ?
The five million people in Norway have one of the highest standards of living , not only in Europe , but also in the world .
Could the secrecy of the country be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely <unk> fish ?
Take up for advanced cheese .
<unk> in the middle of a <unk> and dirty clothing .
Let us wait for a week .
You get the disturbing smell of the <unk> , one of the most popular of Norway .
I am in the small town of <unk> , about 3 hours in Oslo .
<unk> , the landscape is a spectacular one , and the smell of this smell is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of salt and <unk> in water for a period of time - according to the smell that you want it - who can go to a year .
When the darkness is being created and it is cold , the Norwegians come together en masse to attend a festival that is taking place here , in <unk> , devoted to this incredible <unk> speciality .
<unk> thought , then you will have a glass of <unk> &apos; , <unk> <unk> <unk> , a local fire at full-time level that is also called &apos; <unk> General &apos; , responsible for the management of the festival .
<unk> from us , the people who are <unk> from small pieces of fish , and they will have a large amount of drink .
A number of people prefer <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
It kills the smell of the smell .
I am trying to try with a number of pieces .
If you can avoid doing this under your noses , it is not bad - it is a <unk> that would have spent long hours in a bus .
The <unk> dates back to a time when Norway was poor , prior to the invention of the cooling , the fish was <unk> in the air , and then <unk> in the autumn .
Secondly , during the winter , once again , fish has emerged and - without doubt with the meaning of alcohol - eating .
At the previous generation , thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work , mainly to the United States .
Now people are developing rapidly - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by full employment , high wages and a complete health system .
The Swedes , their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway , cross the border to work .
<unk> is considered to be important , although it is a vital element , although it is a vital element of Norway &apos;s past .
It has taken place on the most expensive <unk> .
But everything is expensive - a small beer of beer or a sandwich of all of you .
Norway is not often talking about it in international news , which is not to be <unk> .
In this case , people are not prepared to talk about Mr <unk> , the extremist racist racist who has done 77 people , including women and children .
When they talk about this murder , they talk about &apos; the incident of 22 July &apos; .
The Norwegians have difficulty in accepting that , in their peaceful country , one of their people has been able to make such a barbaric act .
Since the beginning of the 1970s , Norway has to be rich in its oil and gas industry , one of the most important in the world .
But oil is not the unique reason why our success &apos; is the reason for our success &apos; , the <unk> , our <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and the eyes of a blue blue , the image of the Nordic welfare , with a <unk> <unk> .
What we are saying is that we are aware of the fact that we are talking about some cautious people .
Its English , like that of most people living here , is perfect .
We do not like to point out that we want to point out to us .
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - except for a small percentage of money from this industry , is invested in a special fund for future generations .
When other countries are using money from windows , in the years that have led us to the international financial crisis , Norway has been able to keep its money very tight .
As long as we can <unk> in winter and make <unk> in the summer , we are happy to say that we are talking about Anna .
We should not forget the <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; .
I am standing up under snow , and I am queuing up to buy you from what we eat - I have had my <unk> .
On the menu , a <unk> of momentum , a real discovery , is excellent .
This evening , however , the smell of the fish is the smell of the fish .
The hotel in which I am going to be one of the many places where it is used for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most <unk> of them .
There is a TV system where the <unk> is a <unk> , surrounded by <unk> .
It would seem to be the case of the <unk> .
What you have done with the best fish in the <unk> mountains ? &apos;
These are our points , <unk>
There is a need for laughter and applause .
It is a man who is in his chair , perhaps because of the abuse of <unk> .
Perhaps it is because of fish emissions .
There is a difficult start from the Mexican <unk> <unk> <unk> .
While Mr <unk> <unk> <unk> is preparing to take office in Mexico , <unk> <unk> , from the BBC , is interested in the difficulties that await it and the expectations of the people , which are many of them .
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present .
In a city where traffic jams are a lot in normal time , a safety dam has been set up since Monday , blocking several key road access to the capital and causing real chaos on the roads .
Nevertheless , the aim was not to prevent people from travelling to their work , but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Parliament .
Next Saturday , the new President of Mexico , Enrique <unk> <unk> , will receive the presidential <unk> to become the new president of the nation .
It is a complicated task ahead of us .
Mexico &apos;s economy is doing well , results that the outgoing President Felipe <unk> , but the country has a drug war that has already cost the lives of around <unk> people in six years .
&quot; My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence &apos; , said Mr <unk> <unk> to the American President Barack Obama in the Bureau of <unk> a little earlier this week .
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal .
Before the US President , Mr <unk> <unk> was Governor of the State of Mexico .
A very populated and <unk> state of the capital , and on its own land , the views on this new leader are divided .
<unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> , for example , it is enshrined in the memory of everyone .
There is a great deal to be done by the premises of tourism and infrastructure .
To join the city , you can take one of the new motorways of Mr <unk> <unk> , an important improvement has been made to these roads , formerly <unk> and full of <unk> .
<unk> of their name are <unk> outside a new sports complex and an interactive <unk> museum .
We are counting on him to put in place sustainable changes &apos; , stated his friend and political ally Gabriel <unk> <unk> , a member of Congress and the party of Mr <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
In terms of security and economic security , in particular , we hope that there is a real change in which our country needs a change .
After 81 years in power , <unk> Fox was rejected by <unk> Fox .
The member of the <unk> Congress admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of <unk> <unk> , there are many expectations in the party on Enrique <unk> <unk> .
It rejects the critics of the opponents who blame the new President .
It is a whole man , a very committed man , with an excellent vision of the country .
It is an excellent statesman and , above all , he knows to listen .
However , it is not always the image of the people of the former governor .
In <unk> , also known as <unk> <unk> , the contrast to the streets of the streets of the streets of <unk> <unk> could not be more obvious .
<unk> under the motorways of motorways , it is in many respects a suburbs of the city of Mexico .
There are also practical and urban problems in the municipality .
Earlier in the year , the military were called for to fight against drug gangs , and violence against women is particularly serious .
In a disaster area , the number of women who have been murdered in the last two years has been found to be found out of the discharge .
More than <unk> women have been killed in Mexico when Mr <unk> <unk> was Governor , a much higher rate than in the very violent city of <unk> <unk> - a very famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed .
The critics of Mr <unk> <unk> say that , at best , he has failed to stem the problem of the murders perpetrated against women when he was in office .
At worst , they accuse their administration of refusing to see the reality .
In a concrete house , typical of this <unk> area , <unk> <unk> fight to retain its tears when she shows photographs of his dead daughter , <unk> <unk> .
The official version states that suicide was committed by <unk> in 2010 .
However , his family has been killed by his partner .
When I arrived at home , it seemed to me that his body had been <unk> &apos; .
There are signs that it had been beaten up , and it has already been the case of rigid rigidity .
While his mother says history , a photograph of <unk> <unk> the wall , alongside a cross where the word is : justice .
However , this is exactly what the family has been denied .
The authorities have dealt with me as if I was an old <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
They want to be able to accept what they say and that they will be <unk> .
However , it is not right that there should be so many irregularities and omissions &apos; .
When President <unk> <unk> will receive his <unk> on Saturday , he will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility .
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the last six years , and the new President has made the promise that he will make his priority during his term of office .
I hope that it will also be good as President when he was Governor &apos; , and he said that he said , Mr Valle , a member of Congress .
However , this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad <unk> fear .
<unk> <unk> did not complain about ill treatment .
Public prosecutors are trying to counter the abuse of the abuse of <unk> <unk> .
The trial is about the detention of <unk> in a military prison in <unk> .
Defence is intended to classify the matter on the grounds that <unk> has been made in extremely difficult conditions .
The soldier has been accused of the fact that there is a lot of confidential documents .
The prosecutors have tried to demonstrate , Friday , that the soldier <unk> <unk> , accused of being responsible for the biggest flight of confidential information of the whole of the American army &apos;s history , has failed to complain about the mistreatment he claims to have suffered in his military detention .
In a <unk> with <unk> , during a preliminary hearing in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the Public Prosecutor , <unk> Fein , said that there were no complaints about his treatment .
<unk> - during a hearing , defence has submitted a request that the <unk> case be classified on the grounds that <unk> has been made in very difficult conditions and has been a sufficiently tough punishment for his detention .
The <unk> of military intelligence , which was arrested in June 2010 , is accused of the fact that it has been accused of the <unk> of thousands of confidential documents in Iraq .
The documents were then published by WikiLeaks .
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that it has been a source of life .
At the Friday hearing , Fein examined with <unk> the forms that officers had fulfilled after their meeting with <unk> , during his detention in the military prison of <unk> , where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation of July 2010 in April 2011 .
The officers have asked questions in <unk> and have given rise to his answers .
When Fein referred to the forms , Friday , <unk> recognised that the treatment of his guards was &apos; excellent &apos; and that the treatment he had in prison was generally &apos; very professional &apos; .
There is no complaint in the forms of treatment in the form of treatment , even though the officers have asked him about his prison treatment .
<unk> said that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the visit officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they will take care of them , but they have not recorded the problems mentioned .
They wrote &apos; no problem &apos; - having addressed the concerns - and that did not mean that I did not raise problems &apos; .
The military judge <unk> , <unk> <unk> , has also asked for <unk> why he was not complaining about his treatment in a interview in January 2011 with the special committee who met to talk about the suicidal thoughts he expressed in writing a few months ago .
<unk> replied that his intention during the meeting was to change its restrictive status as a result of &apos; injury of injury &apos; .
The military has said that they have had a restrictive status of this kind - a level below the monitoring of suicide - for its protection and safety .
I wanted the staff to know that I was going well , and I wanted to withdraw this statute ... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view .
<unk> has shown on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in Virginia in July 2010 .
He said that he has considered to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait , and he was <unk> once again .
He has added that the fact that he had not been kept informed of what was going to happen or what was happening in the rest of the world was very <unk> .
The world has been reduced to Camp <unk> .
I thought I was going to die in this cage .
Once again , <unk> said that he had spent the most clear of his time in a small cell , at least at 9 p.m. and sometimes more than 23 hours &apos; time .
<unk> also added that the only objects he had had had a <unk> , a cover , <unk> , clothing and glasses .
He has tried to stay on the movement , because sleep or stay on during the day was contrary to the Rules of Procedure .
It has also made it clear that , when he tried to sleep , he had a light in the eyes of his cell .
If the guards did not see its face when he <unk> the night , then they would <unk> him in order to see his face .
The lawyer for <unk> has submitted a formal complaint for the treatment suffered by <unk> in January 2011 .
<unk> has been placed in a military prison in <unk> , Kansas in April 2011 .
On Friday too , the judge asked questions to <unk> concerning a allegation that was reported in his testimony on Thursday , after having been forced to sleep every night in his <unk> cell during the appeal .
<unk> has shown that , at no time , it has been allowed to cover a cover for cover during the appeal .
During the issues of the judge , Friday , <unk> said that he had deducted from his guard that he had to give up his coverage that could have hide his <unk> , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to leave it .
<unk> has shown that he had been forced to sleep at the last night , because he had tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger for himself .
<unk> would have said to the officer that he could have used the <unk> of his <unk> or his <unk> to be injured , but he did not do so .
This <unk> , <unk> has shown that his <unk> , his <unk> , and his glasses were withdrawn from his cell .
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he had to be convicted before a martial court , a trial that should be held at the beginning of next year .
Defence has stated that it is planning to defend the most serious crimes and fight for the abandonment of other charges which are considered too extreme .
The hearing should resume at the weekend , with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified .
The Pentagon confirmed that <unk> was imprisoned in accordance with the Rules of Procedure governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in <unk> .
The charges against <unk> include the theft of goods or public documents , collusion with the enemy , giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet and the transmission of information on national defence .
If all the accused of charge are held , he will face the criminal imprisonment of life .
My identity crisis
It says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities .
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone on ; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times .
<unk> says that the <unk> is being found between two worlds .
In a recent trip to Mexico , coming into the Chamber , before the customs and immigration services , I felt lost .
There are signs of two routes : one for the &apos; Mexicans &apos; ( Mexicans ) , another for &apos; <unk> &apos; ( <unk> ) .
I have remained in the Chamber for a number of seconds , because we do not know how to go .
I grew up in the centre of California , where I was called &apos; <unk> &apos; .
This is an ethnic description , as well as the one my friends in <unk> use when they say &apos; Irish &apos; , or my friends in New York when they say &apos; Italian &apos; .
Secondly , I have become &apos; <unk> &apos; .
However , it was Mexico .
On the land that has been born from my grandfather , no need for a special word or of the Union .
I was simply an American .
I am speaking in Spanish , enough to deal with one language or another .
However , I do not have the vocabulary of a <unk> , and I cannot lose my American emphasis .
So I have taken my American passport and led to the queue &apos; <unk> &apos; .
At that time , I thought that the new Mexican President , Enrique <unk> , visited President Obama , in the White Conference .
In general , when the leaders of these two countries meet , their favourite themes are immigration , drugs and trade .
<unk> <unk> also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy , which is one of the reasons for the Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk in the United States .
It wishes to join with the United States and Canada and to create a Union for trade on the European Union model , but in North America .
<unk> <unk> is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico , although he did not provide more details .
For Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and met with bitterness .
Most of the Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States has invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing .
For the Mexicans , however , who think in terms of centuries , and not minutes , memories are everywhere .
Therefore , as soon as an official official makes any criticism of Mexico , you are starting to hear , in the Mexican press , and among the elites : complaints about how the Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbour .
Children &apos;s children are looking for the fight .
However , for Mexico , the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the most than 35 million <unk> living in the United States .
Do you want to deal with the issue of bitterness ?
There are many of them .
Mexico has the winners and its losers , and the people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them .
The only reason why the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , Denver and San Antonio , has not found any opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the north .
Most often , this person was in line with a different profile : a <unk> skin , <unk> skin , from a poor village .
We are in their descendants , and we are loyal to them .
Not in Mexico .
Even though we are currently living in the American dream , that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations , we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in , not that of Mexicans .
The identity of our identity is sometimes troubled , but our loyalty is obvious .
We give it to the United States .
Furthermore , we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us .
There is a mutual sense of opinion .
Let us remind them of a humiliating defeat , and they will <unk> us as if we were less people , and not Mexican .
The Spanish Government will never be good enough , and our links with Mexico will never be strong enough .
For them , there is a failure to do so .
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico , they would never have been party .
We would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier , which is living comfortably in the United States , but as lost souls .
My wife who was born in <unk> and who has posted legally in the United States , while she was a child , reminds me that there are friction between Mexicans and <unk> , because the Mexicans are calling for more firmly their identity and <unk> .
Although it is a US citizen , it has the feeling of being part of two countries .
On the other hand , many of the <unk> that I know do not seem to be part of one country or another .
It is a question of the <unk> of the Mexican Group , in the case of which , in fact , in the case of the <unk> , , in fact , in the case of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
We have the best of the two worlds , but we are not rooted in either .
In Mexico , we are regarded as the Americans .
In the United States , we are seen as Mexicans .
Now , in order to make the relationship more difficult for the relationship , as I have learned during my stay , some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to move closer to the <unk> .
They want the <unk> to work as a makeshift ambassadors for Mexico , representing its interests in the United States .
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a wonderful country that is to be able to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen links with Mexico .
Yes , of course , it is true that we do not have to do so .
This will not happen .
There is too much bitterness in this area .
If we look at the pay inequalities , corruption and drug violence that are <unk> , many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country .
You will have to do so on their own own .
That is normal .
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States of the way in which they have dealt with Mexico a century and a half , they must therefore accept that some of them always want to do so in the way in which members of their families have been treated so long .
<unk> .
Perhaps we are going to be more &apos; Mexicans &apos; than I thought .
<unk> , the new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace .
Could there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East .
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is in vain .
While there are still the same trivial arguments to know who started , dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them were civilians , and six Israelis were killed ; and the holy town of Jerusalem , the holy city of Jerusalem .
Although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be stuck in the old conflict , there is a change in the Middle East and the Middle East .
The Arab spring of the Arab spring has broken down , and it is not possible for the Palestinians and the Israelis to be caught by this regional upheaval .
Perhaps it will be more difficult for them to be fighting in the future .
However , there are every reason to think that this could help them to get out of this deadly impasse .
A war that does not lose out or no losers .
At first sight , it seems difficult to be optimistic .
Even though the ceasefire has been maintained on 21 November , the fight of this week has strengthened those who are in favour of the force of force , both sides of the world .
The leaders of Hamas , the Islamic movement who have been leading the Gaza Strip since 2007 , will <unk> the Israelis to have forced the Israelis to abandon , even though Gaza has suffered a <unk> .
Having killed some of his leaders and <unk> the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and <unk> parts of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
Indeed , Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank , the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals , the other moderate Palestinian faction .
Moreover , Hamas leaders could be able to say that time is their ally .
The influence of the Arab world Islamists is becoming increasingly strong , and Hamas has been a rich and powerful friends .
Turkey , a growing regional power , in the past of Israel &apos;s closest Muslim ally , has taken place and the cause for Hamas ; just like Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic states of the <unk> .
The members of Hamas <unk> and say that the growing <unk> is going around Israel , since Lebanon , in the north , where the Hezbollah militia has been in its domination , through Syria , where Hamas allies threaten the king .
The most important thing , on the southern flank of Israel , is the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the Presidency of <unk> <unk> in Egypt , by far the most populous and most central of the Arab countries .
<unk> Mubarak , the dictator who ruled Egypt for 30 years to fall in 2011 , had little time to devote to Hamas .
On the other hand , the Muslim Brotherhood is of Hamas &apos;s cousins and their leaders are more easily involved in the public .
In future diplomacy , Hamas can emerge as an important player , which can no longer be excluded from Israel and America .
Meanwhile , the supporters of Israel &apos;s hard line will draw the opposite conclusions .
In military terms Hamas has been given a box .
The missile interception system known as <unk> <unk> has proved to be effective and has been destroyed by many Hamas missiles .
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their ears for some time .
In terms of diplomacy , America has renewed its full support ; and many European countries have criticised Hamas for being behind the last wave of violence .
Above all , however , Israel has been successful , particularly under <unk> Netanyahu , who has completely ignored the peace process .
Although the rocket attacks from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been spared by suicide attacks , particularly thanks to the separation barrier that continues to extend despite their illegality in international law .
Mr Netanyahu , whose <unk> party has merged with an even more warmongering party , the leader of the leader of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the run-up to the election of 22 January .
Why are we going to put these Palestinian <unk> into account by giving them a state ?
If they were in the West Bank , will it not be rockets , as their compatriots did in Gaza ?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and strike them out as soon as they are .
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will prevail , but it may be that the Arab Spring will change .
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere value little of Israel , their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries .
The defence of Israel &apos;s budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours .
To start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to put their economies in order .
Mr <unk> has been working with Barack Obama in order to get a ceasefire on a ceasefire what is a good omen .
The Israelis should also think about the future .
With the rest of the Arab world , which is becoming more democratic , to deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg which is doomed to explode in Israel &apos;s occupied territories - a little like the bus that has exploded in Tel Aviv this week .
<unk> is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state , and demography is exacerbating this problem as the Arab population is increasing .
It will be a diplomatic price for all two or three years for the bloody missions against Gaza .
Both sides need to be driven by outside .
The answer remains to be the right one to be found on both sides , and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper : two states , with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security .
There is hope , a small and short term , that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for the external people to defend this cause .
Egypt , which now needs to get an end to the circulation of arms to Gaza , as well as Turkey and Qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem .
The Arabs &apos; Arabs should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to get together .
This would be a much more important contribution to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal for the UN .
Mr Obama also has a great interest in the fact that Israel can agree to negotiate .
During its first term of office , it has not presented its own peace plan .
A return to the White Paper seems to be very reluctant to establish .
This is a very narrow vision .
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America .
It is a matter of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians .
The laws for neutral cigarette packets have entered into force in force
There are warnings and photographs of <unk> bodies which are all the same , regardless of the same thing as the <unk> .
This law will enter into force in Australia is a global first , the logos and colours have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photographs of sick organs and child representations and babies whose diseases have been caused by smoking by their parents .
Apart from the various photographs and health warnings , the only difference between the packages , since this Saturday , has been the name of the mark , printed in small print on all packages .
This is the most stringent system in the world for tobacco packaging .
The Australian Federal Government has said that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by abolishing all <unk> representation .
Studies have shown that , if people have not begun to smoke before the age of 26 , there are 99 % opportunities that they never start .
&quot; Even when they are very young , children understand the message of tobacco manufacturers through their image of the brand &apos; , said the Federal Health Minister , <unk> <unk> , quoting studies which have revealed that children are <unk> the crown of a logo to a <unk>
Even though Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals , other countries are considering a similar approach .
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law .
Tobacco manufacturers have said that this would be the case of the trade in the black market , which will make it easier to access to cheaper cigarettes .
There will be a negative impact on the basis of this legislation , which has been said by the British American Tobacco <unk> .
The counterfeiters of China and Indonesia will be much more counterfeit on the streets of the streets of Australia .
Others have said that there has been a great deal of work in this area .
Mrs <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a small family company , said that the request for cigarettes for cigarettes , particularly in silicone , to conceal the terrible packaging , has increased a great deal two months ago since British American Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan , contested the law and lost before the High Court of Australia .
<unk> has said that it has sold it out to be sold to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal .
For us , it is good for us to do so .
The only thing that has been said by the experts is the popularity of the social media and the population of the population .
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising , sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to conceal cigarettes , tobacco marketing is now available online .
Australia has banned advertising on the web by companies and local sites , but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so .
If you are working in the marketing of tobacco and that you have no more than a small window of window to promote your products , the Internet is the key place of excellence &apos; , said <unk> <unk> , a public health <unk> at the University of Sydney .
<unk> has noted an increase in the contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of social media marks such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who love <unk> cigarettes and who has given the trouble to make a video , or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency ?
British American Tobacco <unk> has said that the industry focuses on the new regulation rather than marketing .
Industry has gone so far to pay Ukraine , Honduras and the Republic of <unk> to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries have said to the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged , although none of these countries have had major trade with Australia .
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013 .
<unk> said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws .
Canada has been the first country to make the photographs of warning on packaging in 2001 .
Now these warnings are present in 40 countries , including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
Stricter laws are currently being carried out in England , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photographs .
I am not happy about the pictures of the photographs .
I am not aware of them .
<unk> you are taking a cigarette and you will <unk> the package &apos; , and he said Victor El <unk> at the time of buying a package on which there is a <unk> <unk> .
To be frank , the only reason why I shall stop , is my small daughter .
James <unk> , management of the &apos; King of the <unk> <unk> &apos; in the Sydney centre , said that the uniformity of packaging makes it difficult for the packages on <unk> .
Before I had an hour , I had to take an hour in order to take up a package , and now I have four hours &apos; said &apos; <unk> &apos; .
The government only had to ban them once and for all , and we would have said that it is good , it is good , we stop and put the key under the door &apos; , has added , by lifting the arm of the sky .
In a constant world , it may be a good thing to be <unk> .
I spent five hours in an airport during the period of <unk> , because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane .
Therefore , I have had enough time to think about the issue of the problem .
I am not going to lie .
It is rather boring to move a half in an airport to wait for a flight , even when you have books , magazines and <unk> to distract you ( without forgetting duty-free shops ) .
More and more , however , some academics and specialist experts in the development of the child are praising it .
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be <unk> in time .
This is something that is needed to take advantage of the brain .
As we are , most of all , in the face of a number of kinds of screens , we are no longer aware of the benefits of the problem .
So , then , we should welcome with open arms .
Yes , yes .
No .
However , I will come back to that .
First of all , like many people , I thought that the <unk> was a rather recent phenomenon , particularly since we have more time .
But that is not the case , Mr Peter <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> University , in Canada , Canada , and the author of &apos; <unk> : <unk> University &apos; ( <unk> University , 2011 ) .
There is a great deal of concern for the <unk> .
On the <unk> walls , there are Latin <unk> , which are talking about the whole of the world .
Secondly , there is a definition that we are giving to the <unk> .
The problem is that it has been defined and debated in various ways , which has been said in a different way , Mr <unk> <unk> , Professor <unk> of psychology in the <unk> , Canada .
Having come from many publications and submitted the idea of a discussion group of around 100 people , Professor <unk> and his colleagues have defined the <unk> as an experience of &apos; wanting to do something , but without getting into a satisfactory activity &apos; .
There is a difference between the <unk> of apathy , and it says that it is not the case of the person who is doing a job , even though it would like it .
With apathy , there is no desire to do something about it .
What is at the heart of the problem , he said , is &apos; the interruption of the process of attention , associated with a <unk> mood and the feeling that time is slowly .
There is a great deal of confusion in the face of the problem of depression .
However , Professor <unk> said that if both can be linked , the people who are <unk> tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world , while people think that the problem comes from them .
Sometimes , we think that we are going to think that it is a matter of concentration .
In the context of their study , &apos; The <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> in <unk> of <unk> &apos; , which was published in the newspaper &apos; <unk> Science &apos; in September , the voice of a person reading a magazine article .
Some groups have heard , from the Chamber on the other hand , that it is too high in the Chamber , which has not had any report , some of which have just heard on TV , and the third group has not heard the <unk> .
Those who heard the TV on a low level of noise have said that they have become more <unk> than the other two groups - they have had difficulty to focus , but did not know why , and have given this problem of concentration .
When you try to focus on a difficult or political task , there can be a break in the attention of the <unk> , who said Mark van <unk> , a Professor <unk> de <unk> to the University of <unk> in <unk> and one of the authors of the study .
On the other hand , when it comes to a boring task , &apos; as we look at what is going on on a <unk> chain , music can help you not .
In fact , he says , now , we know that , when you <unk> or <unk> , these gestures , which are often regarded as signs of <unk> , are in fact a good way to remain physically more alert .
Studies have shown that the children who are allowed to <unk> have more and more information than those who have been forced to stay without moving &apos; , who said Professor <unk> .
One day , we are all going to be able to take part in our air flight , and I would like to say that there is a <unk> with a <unk> , a particularly boring film .
However , there are some people who are more likely to cause than others .
In order to measure this , researchers have developed a &apos; <unk> &apos; .
There are a great deal of concern for the fact that there are a number of cases in which I do not have any time to do so , and I have so many centres of interest that I have no time to do .
By using such a scale , researchers have discovered that boys tend to <unk> more often than girls , who have said Stephen <unk> , a <unk> teacher in the University of West <unk> , in particular , in need of many and varied incentives .
In general , however , young people are <unk> .
In 1991 , <unk> <unk> , an individual and Community development teacher to the University of Illinois , led to an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a <unk> .
It has pointed out that 32 % of the teenagers who were to be <unk> in school and for their duties at home , while 23 % would be <unk> when they were not at school .
On the other hand , 3 % of the parents have said that they would be <unk> .
Professor <unk> said that he did not know whether the percentages of today &apos; s <unk> , or 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
However , he has added that he knew that &apos; <unk> is a time when the problem is at the highest level &apos; , particularly because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do .
If my question is based on my question : is it good for you to do so .
Sometimes , not , because in its extreme form , this can lead to people to take absurd physical risks , make betting or abuse certain substances to spend time , as the studies show .
On the other hand , many philosophers and writers are talking about a link between the <unk> and creativity , as Professor <unk> said , who has been studying the problem for over two decades .
<unk> is the way in which the brain has found you to make it clear that you should do something else &apos; , said Gary <unk> , a <unk> teacher in <unk>
However , the brain does not always know what the most appropriate thing to do .
If you <unk> and use this energy to play a <unk> and <unk> , then you will be happy .
But if you look at TV , then you will be happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
If your child is <unk> and giving him a <unk> , he will no longer be able to do so , but he will not have learned to deal with it alone or <unk> , says Professor <unk> .
It is a matter of course that is going through another &apos; <unk> &apos; .
Your child does not only learn to be <unk> , and he has more control in other areas .
I do not think that we should be proud of the problem .
Just as I do not think we should criticise it .
To feel comfortable outside the constant <unk> created by activities and technology is the objective that we should be aiming for .
Professor <unk> agrees with this .
We need to bore more often on us , but the cause of concern is an acute and <unk> desire to get to something that makes sense .
According to him , what people are looking for is a means of <unk> and to appreciate the time .
In an environment in which we are constantly <unk> &apos; , it has added , &apos; it is difficult to find ways of getting into something when noise stops .
In the <unk> , no directive for the new law on <unk>
<unk> <unk> , 19 years , student in a university and football player in the <unk> , is accused for something that will soon become legal : the possession of <unk> of <unk> and a <unk> used for smoking .
Mr <unk> said that one day in September he and a few friends were on board a car in <unk> , in the fields of the fields , near the border with Kansas , when they were arrested .
After the police officer found the <unk> in the car , Mr <unk> received a quotation to the possession of drugs and material which could be used for his consumption - minor offences , everyone accompanied by a fine of 100 <unk> - and a date of appearance .
We are treated as criminals , who have said that he has said Mr <unk> .
But what is happening here is what is happening .
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote on the <unk> to legalise the consumption of small quantities of <unk> for its personal use , the response to hundreds of cases involving low use of drugs depends more on the place than the law .
Here and in the state of Washington , which has adopted a similar measure , hundreds of crimes involving the use of <unk> have been classified without continuation .
Police services have ceased to charge adults of 21 years and more for minor <unk> , because the law will enter into force in the coming weeks .
However , the public prosecutors who are in the more conservative constituencies of <unk> have called for the business of existing <unk> to be speeded up , and they continue to charge those who possess them .
At the same time , there are a number of cities in the suburbs of Denver until the mountains of the West are now voting to prevent the opening of sale of <unk> <unk> by the state in their areas .
<unk> is going so quickly that I do not know what we reserve for the future &apos; , Mr van den <unk> , the head of the <unk> police , in Denver .
The United States &apos; regulatory bodies also have a lot of questions .
They are looking for directives on how to install a licence system , allowing them to produce , manufacture , distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013 .
They say that the <unk> , whether it likes or not , is in advance on most of the Member States in relation to the regulation on <unk> , first of all , with regard to the use of therapeutic purposes and now on personal use .
<unk> has a more regulated market , and it is a good indicator of &apos; , and it is a good indicator &apos; , a good indicator of the &apos; , &apos; said , as a spokesman for the Washington Board , <unk> Control Board .
However , there is no room for any place or a system , and it is not possible to suggest that we can do more than suggest what works .
There is no real precedent on which we could be based on the basis of which we can base .
The Washington law , which is called <unk> , takes effect on 6 December , which leaves a legal vacuum in a year , when the system of permits will still not exist , while the possession of <unk> will be legal .
Meanwhile , practical questions are still outstanding : how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees appropriate access to authorised <unk> and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a radius of 30 km around a school , a park , a ground ground or a nursery .
There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an agreed trade of cannabis , particularly in the Seattle area of Seattle , declared Ben <unk> , a spokesman for the <unk> of cannabis , a recently trained research group .
On 21 November , the head of the police , <unk> , in <unk> , sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the &apos; City <unk> &apos; ( representative of the Public Prosecutor ) would no longer continue the people of 21 and more who have small quantities of <unk> , and that the police had to stop charge people for this type of immediate crime .
The leader <unk> said that the police would apply to the new court decisions which regulate the activity of those who cultivate <unk> for medical purposes and continue to continue drug traffickers and drug dealers .
In <unk> <unk> , in the north of the <unk> , the &apos; <unk> district &apos; ( Public Prosecutor of the Republic ) , Ken <unk> , embodies a stricter vision .
After the vote , he said that his office would continue to deal with the business of <unk> , mainly in order to put pressure on users so that they do so .
At present , 119 people have been charged with 56 grams or less <unk> , but many of them are subject to other charges .
The Bureau has a duty to prosecute those people who have committed a crime which , at the time of the facts , was recognised to be a recognised offence &apos; .
The reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as <unk> <unk> , where voters have rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of <unk> .
Great <unk> , the largest city in county , is no longer to be given adults with limited quantities .
The representative of the Public Prosecutor in the county , <unk> <unk> , supported this decision , but has also decided not to classify all cases of detention of <unk> .
I do not have the impression of losing my time to continue to apply the law until it changes &apos; , he said .
Although 55 % of the voters in the <unk> have supported the measure , it is easy to provide an appropriate legal and government framework for the personal consumption of <unk> is not easy .
The contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalisation of <unk> .
&quot; It is a cultural barrier &apos; with the representatives of the Public Prosecutor , declared <unk> <unk> , a lawyer in Denver , who represents the people accused of <unk> and who is speaking as a local spokesperson for the &apos; National <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> &apos; .
They have spent a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people who are <unk> from <unk> , and they have no difficulty in accepting that it is legal , he said .
As the first state to deal with the limited consumption of <unk> at the same level as alcohol , <unk> and the state of Washington are becoming a case of case-law for the legalisation of drugs .
While the defenders and representatives of the state provide for a new <unk> border , they are looking forward with concern for the Federal Government &apos;s directives , which always see the sale and culture of <unk> as federal crimes .
Those who are in favour of the legalisation of <unk> are hoping that the Ministry of Justice will be able to do so .
In spite of some of the political arrests of patients with therapeutic <unk> and sellers , the Federal Government has , above all , made it possible for the retail market to be used for therapeutic purposes to exercise in the <unk> , Washington and 16 other states .
It is true that the police is probably not going back the doors to take the doors of drugs , there is a great deal of risk that she is opposed to the <unk> <unk> , a former political adviser of the Obama administration .
Many cities in the <unk> have not waited until the federal authorities act .
In advance of the votes , some local administrations have approved moratoria in favour of the creation of the new sales shops , even though it is only a postponement of a year .
Last week , the city of <unk> has obtained a <unk> moratorium , and it should impose this ban on a 6 months &apos; time .
We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a licence is granted to someone , and then we have to face a federal problem &apos; , which has said Mr Nicholson , a member of the local council .
The Community has voted against this amendment .
We are interested in the public vote rather than voting on the part of the state .
There are a lot of questions .
<unk> <unk> : I was <unk> and excluded from Oxford because I was a &apos; <unk> &apos; .
It is not just the students of today who are being attacked for their opinions .
As far as I remember , I have always dreamed from the University of Oxford .
My father and brother have studied in what was to me an eminent place to know , a kind of Greek <unk> of modern time , which stimulates the two pillars of civilisation , freedom and tolerance .
However , two weeks after I came in <unk> College College at the end of the 1980s to study history , I decided to make my <unk> , causing the first scandal of my life .
My father collapsed , and he has collapsed .
My friends were confused .
The <unk> <unk> newspaper said that I had left the university , because I had <unk> the fact that students from the first round had sexual relations in the Chamber alongside mine .
On the basis of the fact that I was forced to drink in <unk> , he said that he was forced to drink in <unk> <unk> .
The truth was rather funny .
I have fled from that point of view .
Yes , I have fled , because I was the victim of intimidation and the constant harassment of the subject .
Not because of my name rather <unk> , or because I was from a private school .
I was persecuted for one and only reason , and in this cradle of so-called knowledge , I was a victim of racist and barbaric behaviour : my regret , <unk> <unk> , was a very influential adviser from Margaret Thatcher and I was in favour of the <unk> Party .
I would like to say that we are talking about this today .
Well , recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-right students will have the same kind of persecution .
The increasing and institutionalised hatred of students <unk> in Oxford is such that last week , some of them have called for protection of their rights , as well as gay people , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
The Conservative Members in the Chamber , <unk> <unk> , said that they were &apos; often isolated , attacked personally and felt undesirable &apos; because of their political opinions .
They want to see a representative in the University of the University for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely .
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary of BBC <unk> &apos; <unk> : Young , <unk> and the <unk> &apos; ( &apos; The <unk> country : Youth , <unk> and <unk> &apos; ) , devoted to the policy of students , and which <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; as <unk> and <unk> .
It was found to be found in particular by the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the former President of the &apos; Oxford University <unk> Association &apos; , who is moving into <unk> , <unk> a complete <unk> and moving with a cane <unk> .
In other universities , conservative students say that they are treated as scapegoats for the introduction of the increase in school costs .
<unk> <unk> , 20 years , Vice-President of the &apos; <unk> University Association &apos; , said to a newspaper on Sunday &apos; that there is a growing left-wing party in universities .
People think that we are like the <unk> Club without even meeting .
<unk> <unk> , 21 years , student in the corpus of corpus , who proposed a motion for more protection , says that such a climate is &apos; uncomfortable &apos; , and <unk> <unk> , 19 years ago , the President of the <unk> , says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of the members of the <unk> to those who are centre-right .
This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates , as well as to the welfare of the members of the European Union .
I was the only one to think in this way during my first weeks in Oxford .
I came into September 1986 , I was 18 years old and <unk> timidity .
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very strong .
The previous year , the university voted against the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an <unk> title because of reducing funding for higher studies .
The atmosphere has been responsible for Stalinist vibrations .
From the early days of the reception week , when new students have been aware of the others and teachers , I had a foretaste of what was going to happen later .
I discovered that the teachers were not only involved in <unk> students , but that they were happy to do so .
It was as if the policy on minors strikers , privatisation and opposition from the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was set out in the timber of the class rooms .
The first <unk> of which I was the victim was a translation to English of the French texts of the <unk> century , and I was not prepared for it .
<unk> <unk> &apos; , said Professor <unk> <unk> ( now died )
I have lost my job .
<unk> , a small man in the face of the <unk> , is easy to see .
There is no doubt that the <unk> will not learn from the French or are they just stupid ? &apos;
The other students have <unk> .
I have a blind eye to the tears .
&quot; I suggest that you take French course during your free time - finally , if you are not too busy to make friends &apos; , he has launched a <unk> tone .
I have returned to my Chamber , <unk> .
At the dinner this evening , I have been alone on my own , and I have felt a little <unk> on my side .
It was a student in the second year of English studies , appointed James James , who presented himself as a member of the <unk> .
I know what you have said , he said , please .
I am afraid that this is the case .
Anyone suspected of being a <unk> ( conservative ) is being targeted .
It is quite hard for me , but they know that the father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be even harder for you .
Most young people are claiming to be Labour ( Labour ) .
Later , in the local <unk> , I have tried to hide in a cowardly manner .
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher said .
This trick has failed .
A student in the first year of philosophy , political and economic science who , ironically , had studied in <unk> , said : &apos; You are the daughter of a fascist pig .
You are going to be contaminated .
Other students have taken up the refrain .
It was a dirty , dirty one .
What are they doing about them , and they have asked for one of them .
They are knocking on each other .
I felt to be the case of homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s .
Is it possible to have a normal life in Oxford .
<unk> was forced to meet with people who share the same views only after the night ?
What is the case of Labour and to deny my views ?
The next three years would like to look like a <unk> of <unk> and isolation .
The only teacher that was openly <unk> was <unk> <unk> , of modern history in my university .
It was <unk> not only because he was conservative , but also because he was advising in foreign policy and one of the authors of his speeches .
It was almost up to us .
It would <unk> this provincial and insignificant place and its accession to the point of view of history .
In 1997 it was a teacher of <unk> University , in Ankara , in Turkey .
<unk> you will not be happy here , he told me .
I started to go back between Oxford and the house of my parents in London , which has refuge in my family and my friends , more open in mind .
I have said to my father that I am <unk> Oxford and explained to him why .
It was <unk> .
During its studies in Oxford , in the 1940s , all political views were accepted .
However , it was the best place in the world &apos; , he told me that he said <unk> .
They would not do so , not in the city of <unk> <unk> .
Even my communist friends have been able to do so in the same way .
He had tears in the eye .
Let us give a chance to give a chance .
I am sure you will be able to do so .
I would like to make sure that you are at the heart of my heart .
<unk> by my frequent travel in London , my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated .
A friend , also <unk> , has succumbed to the pressure and has given up his convictions .
During a sitting of the next week , when another professor of history suggested the world most seriously , I decided to do the same .
It is a matter of shame that I have admitted to be a victim of the <unk> of my parents and the <unk> of <unk> .
There has been a short space of time for the time .
It is my father who has <unk> the last nail in my coffin .
At that time , he wrote two <unk> in the <unk> press every week .
My door was <unk> .
I have been <unk> in my Chamber , and after five minutes , my <unk> abandoned .
When they took place , I did my <unk> and took the first train in London .
I have never returned to this .
You may be able to deal with <unk> <unk> .
However , no one of 18 years should be subjected to such intimidation in school .
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford , which not only has produced 14 prime ministers , but also has a strong reputation of equality and freedom of thought .
<unk> prefer to be <unk>
In the context of the exhibition &apos; <unk> : a <unk> of <unk> &apos; , opened this week in London , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and other famous <unk> of Italian <unk> .
This is the only place of the British capital worthy of an exhibition on <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> recognised it at the opening of &apos; <unk> : a <unk> of <unk> &apos; , a prestigious <unk> that meets more than 130 <unk> models created for his house of <unk> over the last 50 years .
I love this palace &apos; , he said that he said that he said his Italian emphasis .
This exhibition is the culmination of a history whose only player is &apos; it <unk> &apos; , but it could not have been written without its famous <unk> .
<unk> has always been fascinated by the closed world , apart from the noble .
In the first Chamber of this exhibition , open to 3 March , an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the <unk> , since the <unk> <unk> Khan , to Lord <unk> , by the <unk> <unk> of Greece and Margaret from England .
It is a personal memory of the <unk> of the town of <unk> , in the north of Italy , in the <unk> of the International <unk> .
There is nothing wrong with <unk> .
At least , they do not crush their cigarettes of cigarettes on your magnificent carpet , as some stars are doing in the face of <unk> music , which is said by Baroness <unk> <unk> .
In the 1960s and 70 , we were both living in the Alps and were good friends .
<unk> is a spectacular guest , with generosity and <unk> .
We will all be invited to be invited in his <unk> of <unk> &apos; , which is why Mrs Thyssen &apos;s &apos; <unk> &apos; <unk> , a strong friend of the time spent as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
<unk> has always preferred to be <unk> .
Even so , it is a <unk> .
<unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , has not forgotten the <unk> of the <unk> .
Several years ago , after a <unk> in Spain , in Rome , we went to dinner at the dinner .
There were some 20 people , including Mr Sharon and John Kennedy .
In every detail , in any detail , there was a great deal of interest in the <unk> of the <unk> .
With him , there was a great deal of interest to be given to him , and it was appreciated that he had a great deal of interest , and he was aware of the &apos; leading model &apos; , which began working with him during the <unk> week in Paris .
It will never come from any way , because there is a need for the creation of the art of works of art .
Let us follow up in line with you
The life of the life of <unk> is not a <unk> story , but it is shared by <unk> .
He likes to do so , and it likes to do so .
One of the <unk> House galleries has been turned into a <unk> <unk> of sixty metres which proposes exchanging roles : the visitors are taking the place of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in &apos; <unk> &apos; , or a <unk> and fur .
Among this public of <unk> , there are names such as <unk> of Luxembourg , <unk> von <unk> <unk> , <unk> from Norway , Bulgaria or Habsburg .
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Many of his <unk> say that there is a great deal of <unk> clothing like the first love , and it is not possible to forget &apos; impossible &apos; .
I would like to remind you of this .
This was a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; and a <unk> <unk> .
It was a gift to me that he was a gift to him , and he said that he said that he said that he was <unk> <unk> .
I would prefer to say that I would like all the others for his <unk> , and that is a great love for women , and it is a great love for the <unk> of the <unk> .
I am very much in favour of the colours that they use , and they are <unk> .
There is a great deal of proportions to be done about this .
The <unk> and <unk> , Mrs <unk> , must not forget the first time that he has been able to forget the first time he has taken up a <unk> model .
When he was an <unk> and lived in Italy , he dreamed of the age of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his <unk> .
Finally , it was possible at the end of the 1990s .
I bought my first <unk> model for a celebration in the house of <unk> , Prince <unk> <unk> .
It was a red <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It was a dream that has become a reality , and it has said that he has said that it is a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> is indifferent to the way , it is obsessed with the <unk> of the <unk> , and it is obsessed with the Italian <unk> , and it is obsessed with the <unk> of the Italian <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> retains the <unk> of the <unk> with &apos; the greatest care , because a <unk> of the evening is not just a <unk> , she is also the whole of the memories that it is making &apos; .
The &apos; king &apos;
The great end of the exposure of the House &apos;s exposure to <unk> House is the <unk> of <unk> Miller , which is in fact , in the case of his marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995 .
It has taken four months of work and 25 &apos; <unk> &apos; ( the <unk> calls for his <unk> ) to carry out this <unk> <unk> with <unk> of <unk> , twelve kinds of different <unk> and a delay in four and a half metres .
According to the journalist <unk> <unk> , the supreme press authority , this <unk> is an historic fact of the high <unk> of the end of the 20th century , &apos; the return of the high society &apos; .
For years , it is a good thing for us to have a &apos; <unk> &apos; &apos; <unk> &apos; .
<unk> di <unk> <unk> ( the greatest distinction in Italy ) , <unk> del <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> de <unk> , <unk> <unk> as any husband of his <unk> .
<unk> , calm , and in the light of the word , he has been treated as well as his <unk> .
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a dinner in the <unk> Museum .
He was sitting on the table of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It was a good thing for us to do not have any effect over the past .
If this is a man who says this ...
The most hard profession in the world : <unk> <unk>
For four euros , there is a risk of the <unk> of the Indonesian volcano and their health with 70 kilos of sulphur .
There are people who are in the way of hell and others who work in hell .
This is the case with <unk> <unk> , one of the 400 minors who earn their living by bringing the sulphur of the volcano into the east <unk> <unk> to the east of Indonesia .
It has to work on a daily basis to the bottom of the <unk> , where gas <unk> from the <unk> of the earth will be <unk> .
After all , there was a great deal of sulphur <unk> , which is a total of almost 70 kilos , and they are setting up them in two <unk> in <unk> .
There are only 250 metres up to the volcano of the volcano , which was in <unk> metres , but the <unk> of the <unk> , but it is up to be more than 40 minutes in the market .
They know that a false step could cost them for their lives , as has happened to a French tourist that has fallen into a deadly fall in the <unk> <unk> volcano several years ago .
The minors of <unk> <unk> earn five euro cents for each kilo of sulphur .
Once again , it is a path between tourists who <unk> them as if they were a circus of circus , and they are working hard with heavy <unk> , they are working the 3 kilometres until the balance of a mining company in <unk> metres .
It is a question of <unk> <unk> , a company that is exploiting the volcano since 1960 , and it can be said that its employees , who pay <unk> <unk> Indonesian ( 5 cents ) per kilo of sulphur .
It is then selling it to <unk> <unk> ( 83 cents ) to the <unk> industry , since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to launder sugar .
As we transport around 70 kilos , we are gaining around EUR <unk> <unk> .
Everyone takes 3 hours and has an end to the end of the day , but it is an end to the end of the day , but it will make it possible for him to win <unk> <unk> ( EUR <unk> ) at the end of the day .
Although it may seem to be a misery for such an effort , it is the three of what it would gain in the fields of money .
The income of minors is very high here , where the coffee harvest is paid <unk> <unk> ( EUR <unk> ) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million <unk> ( EUR 167 ) , says the <unk> that was used as a <unk> on the tourist island in Bali .
There , his salary was <unk> <unk> ( EUR <unk> ) per day and the job was not so difficult , but it was a <unk> , and I have reduced it to <unk> so that she will become Islam &apos; .
<unk> is suffering from asthma , with difficulty , and it is a matter of difficulty , and it is a matter of concern to him and his eyes to his eyes .
On 27 years , he has spent three of his life to defy the danger of <unk> <unk> , but sulphur has already begun to pay for the bill , although it covers the face with a <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> is suffering from asthma , and it is a matter of difficulty , and it is a matter of great difficulty , and it is a matter of concern to him and his eyes is angry by the <unk> of the <unk> .
That is the price he has to pay for his dream .
I am going to work for two years now , because I want to open up a shop or look at Spanish or French &apos; <unk> in a more than acceptable English &apos; .
<unk> by life , this young and intelligent , could be used as a tourist guide , a <unk> or <unk> in a hotel , but instead he does the work of a <unk> .
He shares a <unk> of <unk> wood with others , who are standing every day in the morning , because sulphur is not going to be <unk> at night , when its yellow colour becomes blue and is conspicuous by the dark .
<unk> the darkness , let us get down to the end of the <unk> , <unk> up with a small <unk> of his <unk> , and he bought himself with his own money .
There are some 400 people who have been carrying out the sulphur <unk> on their shoulders since the bottom of the <unk> .
Despite its comfortable benefits , the mining company has not <unk> the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment for those who work on their own and are paid to the weight .
In addition , they do not affect any of the <unk> <unk> ( EUR <unk> ) of the increase by <unk> , in addition to the entry of <unk> <unk> ( EUR <unk> ) , that the guards of this natural park would charge tourists who come from the volcano and his human <unk> .
This work is being done for the animals , not for human beings , who have been protesting against <unk> , a <unk> of 42 years who has been working in <unk> <unk> for thirty years , since he left the College .
It is up to 110 kg to make sure that he will not stop working &apos; until he can &apos; , because he needs money to raise his three sons , between 10 and 18 years old .
I will not take my retirement , I am speaking here because the volcano is my life .
Although sulphur damages the throat and the eyes of the eyes when the wind is turning and the trap of minors in the <unk> <unk> of the volcano , they are so difficult that no one complains about suffering from serious diseases ... to which their usual respiratory problems are , of course , their usual respiratory problems , <unk> , pain and shoulders .
By balancing the basket on its backs , <unk> , <unk> , can only take over 50 kilos .
Every day , his companions and <unk> 15 tonnes of the volcano of the volcano , which have been carried out by three lorries in <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> of <unk> , to 18 kilometres from this by a <unk> of <unk> .
I am not going to retire , and I am speaking here because the volcano is all of the life of my life , and he says that it is <unk> by opening the mouth , <unk> several missing <unk> .
The <unk> of his five children , as well as 30 years old , is working as a <unk> .
Time is going on , but poverty perpetuates a generation of the most difficult professions in the world : the one that the human <unk> of the volcano <unk> <unk> is doing .
Singapore research to save babies
<unk> are responsible for this lack of children on career , stress and the cost of access to property .
The people of Singapore must develop &apos; .
I am a husband and a patriot , and you have been a wife and a patriot , and let us do so far , and let us give life !
It may seem incredible that these words come from an advertising for <unk> , but , in spite of this , the video has spread as a powder <unk> in Singapore at the beginning of this year .
The words have come from a group of <unk> , which uses local references as &apos; let us put a <unk> in the drawer &apos; to make a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore .
<unk> , the advertising agency for the video of video , hopes to draw attention to the problem with this advertising .
The creative director , Douglas <unk> , said that he wanted to use the power of music so that people do &apos; their national duty &apos; .
It is aimed solely at the Internet , so we have been able to make it <unk> and amusing .
This is the main problem in that country .
We feel the worst in the world in the area of birth birth , and we feel that this is something that we have to address .
We knew that there was a number of things that the government had tried to do , and that is something that has been done by the way in which we were to launch fragrances in <unk> or to organise <unk> .
Many of these ideas were creative , but they did not necessarily work .
So we have been told : what more creative things are to be done in order to solve this problem than a <unk> song ?
<unk>
The Singapore Government does not take so lightly .
It spends USD <unk> per year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children .
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers , as far as USD USD <unk> , is a child for a child , extending maternity leave maternity .
However , all of this has had little effect .
Singapore is a rich and high technology of South-East Asia , which is also known for conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
The birth rate in Singapore , in accordance with its national distribution of population , is currently 1.2 children .
The last time he has been above 2 , which was considered as the renewal rate , was in 1976 .
Why do they not have more children ?
<unk> Wei <unk> , Director-General of the <unk> and family policies of the National <unk> <unk> , says that this is due to a &apos; better education &apos; and &apos; a broader choice of career opportunities &apos; .
This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of living objectives and priorities , beyond marriage and the establishment of a family &apos; , <unk> .
These changes to social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of single and delaying marriage , which has resulted in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore .
In the meantime , a immigration policy to increase immigration in order to counter the reduction of the population has created resentment within the local population .
In Singapore there are websites that are in agreement with <unk> xenophobia against new immigrants , in particular the Chinese who are accused of making wages to the bottom and not to integrate .
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore last year has had its worst election results since independence .
Since the elections , they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers .
<unk>
While the fall of the birth rate has known on the economic growth of a country , tax revenue , health costs and immigration policies , the example of Singapore has unexpected consequences .
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses .
For example , this has begun to affect the property sector .
The urban development authorities have begun to monitor the number of small flats known as &apos; footwear box &apos; , which can be built in specific areas of the city .
These flats have an area of 46 square metres and their sale has a great deal of success .
However , the authorities are concerned that they are able to promote a lifestyle and discourage promoters who want to build large family houses .
However , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the Director-General of the <unk> <unk> Society , says that his &apos; shoes of shoes &apos; sell much faster than larger housing .
They are more popular , in the sense that these homes are built more quickly than the larger ones .
For this reason , it is much more profitable for our treasury .
However , it admits that the new standards give more clear instructions to the promoters , who were previously put in the way if they wanted to propose too many small housing in a project .
Too much emphasis has been made .
Singapore is a <unk> .
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , in discussing with the <unk> working in the centre of the centre , it would seem that they do not have a great deal of effect .
The people are very <unk> , the houses are expensive , as are education , and that is why people will put it back on &apos; , says a young framework .
The other people can have children .
However , I think it is important for me to have my money and my time , and we declare another young young of the twenty years .
Men and women mention their careers , stress and cost of access to property and education , as the reasons for preventing them from having children .
Thus , although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children , when it comes to making babies , it is the <unk> themselves who have the last word .
What is being private is deprived of the <unk> .
<unk>
In accordance with the <unk> of the Academy <unk> Spanish , this is the quality of the private sector or &apos; the area of private life that we can protect from intrusion &apos; .
What is the case of the private sector for the least of 16 years ?
How can we apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks ?
Is it the case that the dangers of the Internet are being used on the Internet .
The <unk> newspaper has asked five young boys , between 10 and 15 years old , to use frequent users of the Internet .
In four cases , they have associated with the term &apos; something very personal &apos; and &apos; the word &apos; <unk> &apos; when they applied to social networks .
&quot; I am not going to <unk> my most personal secrets in a post &apos; , says Jorge , ten years , when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , where he has had a account for two years .
These are very secret secrets , my mother can know them , but not everyone else .
On <unk> , I am in favour of <unk> images or games .
I am also discussing with my friends .
I would not like one of my photographs or someone who would put the <unk> &apos; .
The young boy <unk> that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs , <unk> people , crimes or write of humiliating or violent comments .
Mr Solana will ensure that he knows his 35 friends on <unk> and his nine subscribers on Twitter .
The majority of the family is a family .
His mother , in fact , is one of the words of the report .
I have opened up an example of Twitter to speak to you and write some interesting <unk> .
I do not know whether they are responding to me .
The social networks are being <unk> , and I can speak with the parents who are far away or with my friends , who he says .
It says that he would never accept the request for an unknown person .
Nor will he have any confidence in the person who will be able to do so .
The case of José years ago is different .
The teenager has the accounts of <unk> , Facebook , <unk> <unk> and Ask , and he admits that he does not know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends .
I am not concerned about the fact that we have something in common , for example , that is to say , &apos; <unk> &apos; .
According to the boy , no one has made an advance of advance or asked him for his telephone number .
If they were to put pressure on the pressure or demanded it , I would simply ask them to do so .
Mr José , after having read a recommendation on Twitter , has agreed with him .
The experience we have today in the name of <unk> is not alien to the boy .
close to one of my friends was <unk> on a social network .
They have threatened it and demanded money .
He has never been able to know that he was able to do so .
The victim , according to José , has not closed his account .
It has just been a private profile .
It is therefore a question of a series of manipulation to be made in a safe manner .
Unlike Jorge , this young <unk> of the pictures of knowledge in <unk> or embarrassing situations .
Yes , I would do so if I was angry or <unk> .
Even though I know that it is <unk> , <unk> .
Questions
<unk> <unk> , a teacher of English and dismissed in education and <unk> , considers that , in order to guide children and adolescents , we must understand that the aim of social networks is to inform .
The Internet has arisen as a means of seeking information but , with the appearance of these sites , the rule of the game has changed &apos; .
Let us point out that the <unk> Marc <unk> , who has a Masters <unk> of the University of <unk> and author of the <unk> <unk> , uses these words to explain the phenomenon .
Digital <unk> , children and young people were born with technology .
We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , while we ourselves are learning &apos; .
It adds that the subject is complex , &apos; because we are asking them to have a criterion defined on what is appropriate or not to disclose , to publish or say to a age when they do not have the maturity to do so &apos; .
We are also asking them to be selective when what is important to them is to be popular , to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences &apos; <unk> .
According to the specialist , the most effective way of teaching the confidentiality of children and adolescents is to use issues that reflect them .
They do not have to say that they do not do so .
Secondly , let us set out a few examples : there are things that you do not want to do with a foreigner , so that the Internet on the Internet ?
Or do you know that they publish a photograph of you like that of a friend that you have published ?
<unk> what the others are publishing on you ?
When are you going to look at the photographs of the other people to be able to identify them with photographs .
Furthermore , does everyone need to know what you are doing at every time ?
Another point is to make it clear to them that they must act online as they do out of line .
These are the same rules .
<unk> from the Internet , everyone must act with respect , morality and other principles , and this must be done on the social networks &apos; <unk> .
<unk>
The International University of University , University of University , primary <unk> , <unk> <unk> , says that it is essential for parents to read the conditions for using social networks carefully .
With each of the words , they will have solid foundations to discuss with their children the implications of opening up an Internet account .
For example , the age and what it is allowed to be able to share or publish &apos; , &apos; .
There is a need to remind children that it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners .
The <unk> Summit ended without the Lima Declaration .
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of <unk> nations ( <unk> ) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration was made public , although it was announced earlier and in theory adopted by the 7 Members present .
<unk> has repeatedly tried to have access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the <unk> , but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially pointed out that it would be published after the end of the summit and then said that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian Government .
When they were asked about the text , they pointed out that the content of the report was presented by the President of Peru , <unk> <unk> , in short statements to the press .
The access of journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited .
During the day , only video without one of the presidential assembly with the message &apos; private , <unk> <unk> &apos; was broadcast in the press room .
The very little information that is circulating between journalists and journalists has been given to the fact that there were some of the governments of the <unk> , with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman .
The only <unk> document at the day was the list of Presidents present , which caused a certain unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more important information .
Later , the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the &apos; final declaration &apos; of the summit , but it was President <unk> &apos;s speech , not the official document that concluded the summit .
Last October Peru was the guest of the third Arab Arab Summit ( ASPA ) and , on this occasion , although it was requested by the press , it did not broadcast the declaration that was also called the Lima Declaration , as was previously announced .
On the official website , we can check that the document was published in March last year .
In the two international meetings , the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists , but they have limited to the maximum of obtaining information .
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague , which is a different border between the two countries .
The Presidents of Peru , <unk> <unk> , and Chile , <unk> <unk> , met at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the decision of the <unk> to hear the cries of both sides in the trial that Lima brought against Santiago and on Monday in the Hague .
The verdict that will solve the disputes that we have before us today before this International Court , &apos; We will respect the verdict of the European Court &apos; , and it has declared President <unk> , on the side of his Chilean counterpart .
&apos; Chile has always been , and will continue to be , a country that respects international law , the peaceful resolution of the controversies , treaties and international courts &apos; , added President <unk> by giving a handful of hand to President <unk> , alongside the flags of the two countries .
The confirmation of the two presidents that they will be submitting to the ICJ has taken place after Colombia has denounced this week , in which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this International Court , following a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua which it considered seriously wrong .
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil , <unk> <unk> , Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , Bolivia , <unk> Morales , and Argentina , <unk> <unk> .
There was no doubt about Paraguay , which has been suspended since 2011 after 2011 , after the resignation of its former President Fernando <unk> .
The host President , <unk> <unk> , has been responsible for opening up the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit shortly after 12 noon in Lima .
It has read the final document in which he has announced that 16 agreements have been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects were set between the Latin American countries for a total of USD 17 million .
Among the agreements adopted , he mentioned that the countries of the <unk> would introduce &apos; important steps to achieve the aim of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits &apos; .
He informed that action would be put in place to improve the &apos; cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organised crime , actions for better access to medicines , access to the Internet at low prices in South America , and to assess a joint and effective assessment of natural disasters &apos; .
With a Europe in crisis , &apos; economic consolidation ( of Latin America ) must not have a <unk> matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our people &apos; , concluded President <unk> .
We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 <unk> projects that improve the connection of South America &apos;s areas , particularly in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and creating new economic circuits , has declared the Peruvian President in a speech .
Of these projects , he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the cross-cutting axes of its territory , since the coast to Brazil , and that two were aimed at a more important link with Ecuador , although it did not give further details .
Similarly , the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay .
We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of the United Nations , which is currently excluded .
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace , which is an integrated and good relationship with its neighbours , is another issue which is discussed at the summit .
In this respect , the Colombian President , Juan Manuel Santos , said , before start the regional meeting , that he had hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday , following a judgment by Bogota .
It is possible that tomorrow ( Saturday ) , I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega , who said that he has said Mr Santos .
We are going to revise all these things , and they are not exhaustive , including the Treaty with Nicaragua , which is going to ask for a discussion with this country .
I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we are going to deal with this in the most civilised manner , and he has added to Mr Santos &apos; has added to it .
Mr Santos and Mr Ortega will be meeting on Saturday in Mexico , where they have planned to attend the President of the country , Enrique <unk> <unk> .
In the same way , in the context of the summit , the Union &apos;s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the action plan for 2013 , which is trying to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , <unk> and Paraguay are part of the <unk> , although it is suspended .
Peru will be able to see a <unk> of the regional bloc .
South America has to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship &apos; , saying that it is <unk> <unk> .
The President of Ecuador , <unk> <unk> , said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which &apos; South America , in this case , had to take Europe &apos; .
President <unk> , who took part in the Sixth Summit of the United Nations of the United Nations ( <unk> ) , in Lima , said on state television , TV <unk> , that Europeans were now almost a homeland &apos; .
In this respect , he has defended the idea of establishing the establishment of a South American citizenship , which has been encouraged by the Member States .
The free movement of citizens and workers is to be achieved in any Latin American country , as is already the case for the members of the <unk> Community , but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past .
In addition , President <unk> has been in favour of the recovery of the Organisation of the American States , with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights .
Those who <unk> us the ears are never at risk , on the other hand , in contrast to the fact that we in Latin America have signed up to it .
It is incomprehensible that the Commission should have human rights in Washington under the funding of the United States , and it has said that , by referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange .
It does not regret the fact that he does not regret his decision , because he himself has not betrayed his principles , but he has respected his &apos; deep democratic values &apos; .
It concluded that , at the time , there were well-founded suspicions that there were grounds for being extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected &apos; .
In addition , it is critical of Swedish justice , which has demanded that it will submit to its territory with interrogation about an alleged sexual offence when &apos; the own Swedish legislation allows it to do so by video , which could have been done since the Ecuador Embassy in London &apos; .
<unk> said that there is a risk that the physical and physical health of Assange is deteriorating .
I did not talk about him since he was in our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem , but nothing serious was said by Mr <unk> .
It is possible for physical and mental health to deteriorate as a result of the fact that they are being locked up in a small space without free air .
This is about the health of anyone &apos; s health .
Let us point out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the <unk> Embassy in London , which would allow him to travel to Ecuador , is in Britain , Sweden and the European judicial authorities , and it points out that he has had discussions in London to find a solution to the <unk> of WikiLeaks .
We are not negotiating with human rights , but we do not use this word in this case , but there have been permanent discussions .
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain , Sweden and the European judicial authorities , because the lawyer for Assange , <unk> <unk> , has launched a whole series of procedures with different European bodies &apos; .
In the case of the United Kingdom , he believes that it would end up in the future of the day .
If Sweden , as its legislation makes it possible , and as it has already done in other cases , Mr Assange has been asked Mr Assange in London &apos;s embassy , or the question of <unk> tomorrow , the problem would also be resolved .
It has taken advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press , and he has made clear that what he does not want was &apos; mediocrity , bad faith and lies that damage freedom of expression &apos; .
The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil or perverse politicians , but the bad journalists to the balance of greed , blackmail and extortion &apos; .
From this point of view , he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists or bankers or the <unk> and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador and , rather than put forward its re-election , &apos; he will <unk> the revolution to continue the road and to set the right way &apos; .
<unk> has also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the <unk> at least until the next elections , by <unk> that the body &apos; should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempts at coup &apos; , because in fact , &apos; it will be the legitimacy of <unk> democracy &apos; .
What is more , President <unk> considers that &apos; perfectly relevant &apos; the desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel Santos , to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague , which will strengthen Nicaragua &apos;s maritime sovereignty .
At the moment , it is not being respected .
It is a problem between the South American countries and a Latin American country .
Conflicts are inevitable , but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together .
We need to resolve them as a whole and move forward .
At the same time he said that he was confident in the good resolution of the dispute on maritime borders , which is against Peru and Chile in the same court , and he said that it is &apos; beneficial that Latin America takes the international bodies &apos; .
As a reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador , with a view to a third consecutive mandate , he pointed out that he saw this possibility &apos; with great optimism and joy , although it is sometimes quite difficult &apos; .
<unk> assured us that , if it lost the primary primary of February 2013 , he would withdraw from public life .
At a personal level , the power has never been interested in me , but in such unfair situations as Ecuador , this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power .
My political movement believed that it was me who secured this possible victory , but we have to accept this responsibility &apos; , he said .
If I would like to say that I would like to say that it would be my last presidential term , and then I will withdraw from political life .
If we lose up , I will also do so .
That is my decision , he said .
<unk> has also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President , Hugo Chávez , in Cuba .
I have just discussed with the Venezuelan Vice-President , <unk> <unk> , and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he expected the end of the campaign to return to Cuba .
This does not mean that the state of health of President Chávez &apos;s health has been <unk> .
The Head of State <unk> took part in Lima today in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the United Nations <unk> ( <unk> ) , which ended by an appeal to better regional integration in order to support progress , equality and security .
The deaths of AIDS are due to a late detection .
<unk> was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the test of the test : <unk> .
It is as if the sky has fallen on the head &apos; , he says in the case of the announcement that the doctor tried to make &apos; less difficult &apos; , in vain .
The young man has concealed his family .
It has decided to do so on the basis of his illness and has begun to inform him about this and his determination has been such that he has just celebrated his <unk> birthday .
There is no doubt that one of the oldest patients in the <unk> of the civil hospital in <unk> ( <unk> ) , in which he was in 1994 after many battles .
<unk> live with the human <unk> virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s , where there were many doubts , few choices of treatment and more stigma .
So , even the director of the <unk> <unk> , he would be able to tell him that he was able to review it .
In the meantime , it is a death of AIDS .
Today , it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have good quality of life .
However , ignoring their disease , many people are still coming when the virus has already caused damage , and it is the case of which has been caused by the way in which the virus has caused damage , and it is a result of the fact that the virus has caused damage to its immune systems .
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world , in any case after the first cases reported , &apos; the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is the same &apos; , he indicated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication .
The HIV / AIDS expert on HIV / AIDS , <unk> <unk> , has commented that since 2008 the scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease , but that the number of years of survival and the quality of life was dependent on the level of <unk> for those to a rate of 500 .
To speak simply , this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis of 25 years &apos; time , they have been able to live without any problems to be able to live up to 75 years .
In order to put forward this progress in its context , we must be aware that the life expectancy of Mexico is now 76 years on average .
If it is true that mortality has significantly decreased in recent years , in the case of Mexico , the number of people who died as a result of AIDS has fallen from <unk> cases in 2007 to <unk> in 2011 ( according to the annual report of <unk> ) , but it is also true that 60 % of patients registered on the basis of national data have died .
In <unk> alone , 255 people have died in 2011 , and there have been 187 deaths , and there have been 187 deaths , but we are assured that access to antiretroviral medicines has been universal since 2005 .
So , there are still a number of deaths there .
In my opinion , there is no question of access to the problem .
That is how I see it , and that is what happened in our hospital .
In the last 12 years at least , we have never missed medicines , the problem is that patients come at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected , or then they learn from advanced stages of the disease .
It gives us an indisputable fact &apos; nine patients in ten out of ten days that they already have an opportunistic infection , which is what we need to have a greater impact on global mortality , and that is to carry out more early diagnosis and , for this , we need to propose mass screening tests .
The experts and members of the Council of State prevention of <unk> ( <unk> ) agree on his proposal , as well as the patients themselves , as <unk> , who has had AIDS and suffered the <unk> of <unk> , a cancerous cancer that is one of the current complications .
There is a change in the situation when you learn that you have AIDS .
There are some people who believe that they will die and do not want to know anything .
If I am going to die , it is better for me to get out three times a week &apos; s time , and that is not my case .
Change has been beneficial , and I am doing so , and I am doing so well , and I am doing so .
To date , their parents know that he is suffering from cancer .
I have a normal life , as anyone else else .
I am working , I have a great deal of work , I travel , I am travelling , I have an active sexual life , but responsible , I am paying attention to and to the other person who is afraid of those who are afraid today when the World AIDS Day has been used .
They will be able to test the test , if they have taken risks , at the earliest time when they have taken into risk if they are HIV-positive and better , and if they have the diagnosis , they must know that they can live like everyone , by being responsible .
The message of the fight against AIDS in the course of the year in 2012 is to be summed up in the past .
condoms
There are many gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen , which has been supported by the ordinary citizen , which is , in fact , , in fact , in favour of the fact that it is up to the end of the day , and that is something that has been accepted by the ordinary citizen .
The greatest thing is prevention .
In all places for this , &apos; we have increased the distribution of condoms , before we were given one or two , now we have been given 100 % packages , but it is a good thing , but there are still some people who do not have access to condoms &apos; .
One of the most vulnerable to the new infections is young people .
The question is : &apos; What is you going to do ? &apos; , put together with <unk> and judgments by the social workers , the guidance advisers , pharmacists and health professionals , is the question that young people do not want to hear .
It proposes to redirect this ineffective distribution , which is not only to be sold to the shops , but not only to be sold to the shops , but they are not just sold to the shops , but they are being found in the shops and in the places where young people live .
It is not a question of encouraging <unk> .
It is not up to them to pay for girls and <unk> , as the Governor , Mr González , was asked if he was asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration .
This is not the way in which sexuality works , the best thing is to provide condoms to those who are already sexually active .
The figures
There are <unk> cases in which they are <unk> and <unk> .
The state of the country is the fourth state of the country in many of the new cases and the cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients .
92 % of the contamination of the contamination of the disease is being used by means of the use of <unk> and 2 % by <unk> .
It is estimated that <unk> people are living with HIV , because there are four or 5 people who are unaware of this .
A judgment ratified by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the debt of the <unk> group through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico , which is a bad precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems .
It would therefore appear that the procedures for survival of the societies authorised by Mexican law are not valid in the country in the country in the <unk> banner , in <unk> of international agreements .
From a practical point of view , the blow to the judgment of 15 June last year by Judge <unk> <unk> of the Court of <unk> for the northern district of Texas leaves the Mexican companies in the face of the possibility of the embargo on their own properties .
However , the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to seize the Supreme Court of the United States on three inconsistencies .
Firstly , while the judge of the cause points out that creditors must register according to the United States &apos; insolvency law , the <unk> Court of Appeal , in New Orleans , says that the main procedure is commercial bankruptcy in Mexico .
The first point would be to denounce international cooperation cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile .
In fact , the <unk> law of the United Nations for the <unk> of <unk> International Law was set up for this purpose by means of the American law , as a referee .
Secondly , the judgment states that without the <unk> vote , recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy , the debts incurred by subsidiaries of <unk> to the mother society , the majority required for approval of restructuring could not have been achieved .
However , Mexican law recognises this opportunity .
In fact , the case of <unk> is not the first to use this plan .
There are half a dozen examples of this , including <unk> and <unk> <unk> , including the <unk> Institute of <unk> <unk> .
In addition , what is certain is that , as there were the votes of the subsidiaries , all the creditors of <unk> who fought against this in the United States courts , in other words , the &apos; <unk> &apos; funds as <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Liverpool <unk> , would not have obtained the majority .
The vote would have been 45 to 37 .
There is one thing that is missing from the Court of Appeal .
On the other hand , <unk> has been blamed for the difficult situation that he has had since 2008 , without stop to the serious economic crisis that the United States , which has been <unk> the costs to the country .
At the moment , the family society in the same court of appeal to the same court of appeal is called for in its entirety , and that is to say with the five magistrates , as only three voted .
The use of insurance will require <unk> and requires the review of the trial by a higher body , in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States .
The most serious thing is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico in the name of the <unk> <unk> ( &apos; Court of the Court &apos; ) in which the procedure followed by the two countries was detailed in order to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the US insolvency law .
In addition , it points out that the country has led to the principles of the United Nations Commission on Trade International Trade , in other words , the rules for cross-border insolvency cases , which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors .
<unk> from two sides : they are <unk> <unk> and <unk> the country .
<unk>
The complaints of the trade unions of the Aviation Society of Aviation against the <unk> of society , <unk> <unk> <unk> , have been silent for several months , and it was accused of fraudulent administration , the <unk> Association of <unk> <unk> .
The body , <unk> by Carlos <unk> Chávez , has just presented a criminal request against the <unk> National Commission and the <unk> of <unk> .
In his opinion , the inspection authority systematically denied information to the public prosecutor of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from <unk> F / <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the name of the <unk> of <unk> .
The money would have been used for the use of the <unk> Administration .
As everyone knows , <unk> <unk> is the main shareholder of the <unk> hotel chain .
<unk> <unk>
At the end of the week in a <unk> of the Caribbean University , a group of national and foreign Greens , university teachers , entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front to the inauguration of the Chinese <unk> <unk> in Cancún .
As you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean of products of the country of the great Wall , with a residential area for the employees of 150 companies .
In the past , the <unk> ( the National Assembly of Industry and <unk> ) has succeeded in uniting the governors of the south-east area in order to oppose the <unk> draft that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest threat to industry .
ACTA
The government has put forward a request by the Senate to explain in what terms and circumstances the Mexico ambassador in Japan signed the <unk> <unk> Agreement , known as the <unk> <unk> Institute of the <unk> <unk> , which is already in history .
As everyone knows , this has been done well when the Senate itself has condemned this possibility , because it was considered to be an attack on freedom of expression on social networks .
In the long term
With a view to paying long-term debts without any short-term money , the <unk> property developer has started on the stock stock market for 500 million <unk> .
It is the first thing that we are proposing to do with the use of the European Union , which is the first one of four emissions for which they are proposing to pay for all 28 days .
<unk>
<unk> by the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> society , the safety leaders , a new consortium for the social reason , has just created , with the aim of which will be the <unk> of Central American software services and the South .
Investment in this area is over USD 1.5 billion .
<unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> has spent over 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and , thanks to him , travelled throughout the world .
Few people in <unk> <unk> have a knowledge of the history of the local <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> .
The reason for this is that before a brain drain is condemned to the wheelchair in 2008 , <unk> was <unk> in this sport for more than 60 years , whether it is as a a a less than <unk> national team player , <unk> and the President of the <unk> Federation .
&quot; I have made several hats in the <unk> throughout my life , and even several at the same time , as when I was President of the <unk> , Director-General of the National team and President of the federation during the 1990s , his true wife for over 50 years .
<unk> is my life .
It is not an exaggeration to exaggerate it .
The walls of his house , almost all of the photographs of photographs and memories , are shown to be of the kind of <unk> .
<unk>
In all his memories , those who are most aware of them are the ones who remind him of his passage as a player in the team of <unk> in the middle of the 1950s to 1982 , after having spent 15 years as <unk> or <unk> of the team .
It was my best years , which I have benefited most , because I had the chance to take part in eight <unk> championships from 1967 , both as <unk> , <unk> or leader .
For many years , it is a great deal of satisfaction , including the <unk> championships in 1975 in 1975 .
I then withdrew from the championship in 1981 , in the last year when <unk> <unk> entered into the <unk> team .
From that point of view , &apos; <unk> &apos; , which was a great manager , took the lead in the team &apos; s team .
I remember that <unk> <unk> , who was leader here and who was at the University of <unk> ( Birmingham ) , told me : &apos; I have a <unk> player for you , he measure two metres .
Do you want to do so ?
This is how it is possible to start to start with the <unk> of the world .
He then recommended to me that Mr <unk> , who was <unk> , was <unk> .
I remember that he said that if <unk> had allowed <unk> to win a championship , he was going to help us to try to win another .
He was pleased with the <unk> meeting with <unk> , but only from a distance , because in 1988 it was already the great <unk> of the federation .
At the time , he would have preferred to take advantage of his charges and those of <unk> in the national team .
I am reminded of the fact that , for the first time , we have won it in the United States in Mexico in 1989 .
Secondly , there was the World Cup in 1990 , where we arrived at the fourth and where we should have won the <unk> coin if this Canadian judge did not give us the last match , said <unk> .
The World Cup team in 1990 is the best national team that you have seen .
It is one of the best , as is the one who has beaten the <unk> <unk> in the 2004 Olympic Games .
However , I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that in 1991 , in 1991 , when we won the gold and put a <unk> to the United States team , which was quite similar to the one that won the <unk> in the World World .
This team was not only composed of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> López and &apos; <unk> &apos; ( <unk> ) , there were also young people ( Javier ) <unk> and James Carter who was unable to attend the world of 90 because of a problem of their knees .
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals , but it gave us a golden coin and a great joy at the <unk> <unk> in Argentina .
With players such as &apos; <unk> &apos; , <unk> <unk> and the young <unk> <unk> in the replacement of the players suspended by the mess of the <unk> <unk> <unk> Games , we won the gold against all forecasts .
What was the best player in <unk> <unk> ?
Without doubt , this is a question of <unk> <unk> .
Its statistics at international level are impressive .
No one in <unk> <unk> has dominated this , as it did .
This does not take into account the way in which it has taken into account in the various leagues .
Who was the best leader of the world ?
This is a very difficult thing to say .
We have had a good team of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Carlos Morales , Raymond <unk> , <unk> Torres .
In young people , I very much like the work done by Mrs <unk> .
For you , what is your greatest success in the federation ?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995 , and the fact that , at the beginning of the 1990s , there was up to 17 teams in a season .
What is to be done about that ?
There are things that I would have liked to put in place , such as regionalisation of minor categories .
For example , the boys of <unk> are playing in their own area in their own area and are only in the hands of the people in the island .
Today , young people are travelling and do not necessarily have to do so .
At least , I have seen the advantage of compulsory qualifications and courses for the leaders , the staff of the field and the <unk> .
That is a good thing for me to say .
What are you doing today ?
In general , I am listening to music , I look at the <unk> of my time on YouTube , I would like to take advantage of my grandchildren and , in time , I am attending <unk> matches .
Of course , I would like to take advantage of the company of my wife , <unk> , who has always been on my side .
Death of the <unk> player
<unk> <unk> , which was born on 21 September <unk> , in <unk> <unk> ( Texas ) , in the world of John Ross , which was an unscrupulous , formidable and <unk> businessman , in the television series &apos; <unk> &apos; , in which he was an unscrupulous , formidable and <unk> businessman .
<unk> <unk> , whose role as a <unk> of the <unk> oil <unk> Ewing in the television series &apos; <unk> &apos; , has become a symbol of <unk> in the 1980s .
It was 81 years ago .
<unk> , who was back this year in the role of <unk> in a new season of &apos; <unk> &apos; , died on Friday evening of the complications of cancer , according to a family release sent to the <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was back back in his dear home city of <unk> , playing the ironic role that he has enjoyed most &apos; , and he said the family .
The family of <unk> and his close friends were with him in <unk> today .
As a result of his wife &apos; s role in the original and later number , he was with <unk> when he died in a <unk> hospital , he said his press , <unk> <unk> .
It was a great pleasure for all those who knew it .
It was creative , generous , funny and talented , and I am not going to miss it .
It was a person who was an exception , and he lived in a basic life &apos; , he said in a communiqué .
Doctors were diagnosed with <unk> <unk> in 1992 in 1992 , and he had recognised a great deal of <unk> for many years .
In 1995 , it was detected in the liver of the liver , and he had suffered a transplant .
A number of years before &apos; <unk> &apos; , <unk> was made known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series &apos; <unk> of my dreams &apos; broadcast by the <unk> chain of 1965 in 1970 .
In this case , it would be a question of the role of Captain Tony Nelson Nelson , an <unk> whose life was transformed when he found an attractive technology , interpreted by Barbara <unk> , and he was <unk> him home .
It has also played part in two <unk> who have remained short of time in the air , &apos; Life Life &apos; ( <unk> , <unk> ) and &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos; ( <unk> , 1973 ) .
Of its roles in the cinema , there are a good number of roles that are received by criticism in the &apos; <unk> and <unk> &apos; and &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; .
It was , however , thanks to his excellent interpretation of the <unk> <unk> , which was a great success of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The dramatic series of the <unk> chain on the Ewing clan and their relatives was distributed from April 1978 to May 1991 .
The slogan &apos; Who killed <unk> ? &apos; , invented in order to maintain the <unk> around an emotional episode in which the <unk> figure is almost murdered , has generated speculation throughout the world and millions of dollars in betting .
With this , among other things , the series has reached a record of hearing at that time .
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , 41 million viewers were on average before their screen and made &apos; <unk> &apos; the second entertainment programme in the world , following the final episode of &apos; <unk> &apos; in 1983 , which collected 50 million viewers .
It was the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> ( interpreted by Mary <unk> ) .
<unk> it was in this House and then threatened him with prostitution if he did not leave the city , but there were also reasons for attacking it .
<unk> has played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and <unk> man , but a <unk> smile : a dishonest entrepreneur and a <unk> husband who tried to make his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I am aware of what is needed as a <unk> for <unk> in 1988 .
It should be written : &apos; <unk> the honest citizen <unk> Ewing &apos; .
This is the only part that he has lost .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> of the original series , was mentioned on Friday &apos;s Friday , as a man of <unk> , as a man &apos; s small screen and in life &apos; .
It is an <unk> and irreplaceable one for millions of fans around the world , and in the heart of all of us , who have had the opportunity to know and love him .
Ten episodes of the new edition of &apos; <unk> &apos; were circulated a few months ago with a great success on the <unk> chain .
The registration of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and one sixth is under way , and it has been informed of the chain .
At the moment , neither the <unk> nor the <unk> chain have informed about how the death of <unk> will be incorporated into the series .
Coming from <unk> <unk> to Texas , he is the son of the <unk> and <unk> Mary Martin , who <unk> the <unk> with traditional works such as &apos; South <unk> &apos; and &apos; Peter Peter &apos; .
Mr Martin was still an <unk> when she <unk> his day when he was married when she was married to the lawyer Ben <unk> .
He has taken the first step on the scenes of the theatres of New York at the beginning of the 1950s and used in the air force of 1952 to 1956 in England .
It was there that he met with the young Swedish <unk> <unk> <unk> and she married him .
There have been two children who have had a couple of children , <unk> and <unk> , and they have lived for many years in the <unk> town of <unk> .
In 2001 , he called his memory &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; : <unk> ( and <unk> <unk> ) <unk> <unk> <unk> Life ( French : <unk> <unk> ) : <unk> memories of <unk> )
I have nothing written in the book in the book , which would be able to injured someone or affect it in any way &apos; , he said in the press at that time .
After the liver transplant , it has become an active activist of organ donation and working as voluntary in a hospital to assist those concerned .
I would advise them , I will give them confidence , and I come to them with them when they come to work and after &apos; , <unk> in 1996 .
I am trying to give them some comfort , such as &apos; Do not be afraid , it will not be easy for a small moment , but it goes well &apos; .
It has also been a activist against tobacco and has taken part of a number of campaigns .
It has just just just begun to deal with the end of the world .
Every week , students are going to be <unk> , such as nuclear war , <unk> , viruses and the seeds and global warming .
This six months , when the Chancellor of religion <unk> <unk> decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew that he was launching a <unk> <unk> : the end of the <unk> timetable , on 21 December , to which many people refer to the end of the imminent world .
However , Professor <unk> had no idea of what was expected in the following months : the catastrophic hurricane <unk> , a tax gap that some of them said &apos; debt of debt &apos; , and a growing conflict involving Israel , the place where the Christians of the end of the time thought that the <unk> would lead to the <unk> .
I did not realise that it was going to be the most appalling half of the last half of the last six months , and he said that this week , Professor <unk> has said his students from the University of <unk> University ( New Jersey ) .
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later , and that we would be doing so , it was a very good time .
We must remember that what is wrong is good for those who believe in the <unk> .
